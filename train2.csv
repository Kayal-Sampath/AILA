"One Lakshminarayana Iyer, a Hindu Brahmin, who owned considerable properties in the Tirunelveli district, died on 13th December, 1924, leaving him surviving a widow Ranganayaki, and a married daughter Ramalakshmi",Facts

Ramalakshmi had married the plaintiff and had a number of children from him,Facts

"They were all alive in December, 1924, when Lakshminarayana died",Facts

"Before his death he executed a will on 16th November, 1924, the construction of which is in controversy in this appeal",Ratio of the decision

"By this will he gave the following directions -- ""After my lifetime, you, the aforesaid Ranganayaki Amminal, my wife, shall till your lifetime, enjoy the aforesaid entire properties, the outstandings due to me, the debts payable by me, and the chit amounts payable by me",Facts

"After your lifetime Ramalakshmi Ammal, our daughter and wife of Rama Ayyar Avergal of Melagaram village, and her heirs shall enjoy them with absolute rights and powers of alienation such as gift, exchange, and sale from son to grandson and so on for generations",Facts

"As regards the payment of maintenance to be made to Chinnanmal alias Lakshmi Ammal, wife of my late son Hariharamayyan, my wife Ranganayaki Ammal shall pay the same as she pleases, and obtain a release deed",Facts

Ranganayaki entered into possession of the properties on the death of her husband,Facts

"On 21st February, 1928, she settled the maintenance claim of Lakshmi Ammal and obtained a deed of release from her by paying her a sum of Rs",Facts

"3,350 in cash and by executing in her favour an agreement stipulating to pay her a sum of Rs",Facts

240 per annum,Facts

"Ramalakshmi died on 25th April, 1938 during the lifetime of the widow",Facts

None of her children survived her,Facts

"On the 24th July, 1945, the widow describing herself as an absolute owner of the properties of her husband sold one of the items of the property to the 2nd defendant for Rs. 500",Facts

"On the 18th September, 1945, the suit out of which this appeal arises was instituted by the plaintiff, the husband and the sole heir of Ramalakshmi, for a declaration that the said sale would not be binding on him beyond the lifetime of the widow",Facts

A prayer was made that the widow be restrained from alienating the other properties in her possession,Facts

"On the 19th September, 1945, an ad interim injunction was issued by the High Court restraining the widow from alienating the properties in her possession and forming part of her husband's estate, Inspite of this injunction, on the 27th September, 1945, she executed two deeds of settlement in favour of the other defendants comprising a number of properties",Facts

The plaintiff was allowed to amend his plaint and include therein a prayer for a declaration in respect of the invalidity of these alienations as well,Facts

It was averred in the plaint that Ramalakshmi obtained a vested interest in the suit -properties under the will of her father and plaintiff was thus entitled to maintain the suit,Facts

"The defendants pleaded that the plaintiff had no title to maintain the suit, that the widow was entitled under the will to an absolute estate or at least to an estate analogous to and not less than a widow's estate, that the estate given to Ramalakshmi under the will was but a contingent one and she having predeceased the widow, no interest in the suit properties devolved on the plaintiff",Facts

"The main issue in the suit was whether- the widow took under the will an absolute estate or an estate like the Hindu widow's estate and whether the daughter's interest therein was in the nature of a contingent remainder, or whether she got in the properties a vested interest",Facts

"The subordinate judge held that the widow took under the will a limited life, interest, and not an absolute estate or even a widow's estate under Hindu law, and that the daughter got there under a vested interest in the properties to which the plaintiff succeeded on her death",Ruling by Lower Court

In view of this finding he granted the plaintiff a declaratory decree to the effect that the first defendant had only an estate for life in the suit properties and that the alienations made by her would not endure beyond her lifetime,Ruling by Lower Court

The question as to the validity of the alienations was left undetermined,Facts

The unsuccessful defendants preferred an appeal against this decree to the High Court of Judicature at Madras,Facts

"During the pendency of the appeal the widow died on 14th February, 1948",Facts

The High Court by its judgment under appeal affirmed the decision of the trial judge and maintained his view on the construction of the will,Facts

"Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was granted and the appeal was admitted on the 27th November, 1951",Facts

The substantial question to decide in the appeal is whether the estate granted by the testator to his widow was a fall woman's estate under Hindu law or merely a limited life estate in the English sense of that expression,Ratio of the decision

"It was not contested before us that a Hindu can by will create a life estate, or successive life estates, or any other estate for a limited term, provided the donee or the persons taking under it are capable of taking under a deed or will",Ratio of the decision

"The decision of the appeal thus turns upon the question whether the testator's intention was to give to his widow ail ordinary life, estate or an estate analogous to that of a Hindu widow",Ratio of the decision

"At one time it was a moot point whether a Hindu widow's estate could be created by will, it being an estate created by law, but it is now settled that a Hindu can confer by means of a will oil his widow the same estate which she would get by inheritance",Ratio of the decision

The widow in such a case takes as a demise and not as an heir,Ratio of the decision

"The court's primary duty in such cases is to ascertain from the language employed by the testator ""what were his intentions"", keeping in view the surrounding circumstances, his ordinary notions as a Hindu in respect to devolution of his property, his family relationships etc",Ratio of the decision

"in other words, to ascertain his wishes by putting itself, so to say, in his armchair",Ratio of the decision

"Considering the will in the light of these principles,it seems to us that Lakshminarayan Iyer intended by his will to direct that his entire properties should be enjoyed by his widow during her lifetime but her interest in these properties should come to an end on her death, that all these properties in their entirety should thereafter be enjoyed as absolute owners by his daughter and her heirs with powers of alienation, gift, exchange and sale from generation to generation",Ratio of the decision

"He wished to make his daughter a fresh stock of descent so that her issue, male or female, may have the benefit of his property",Ratio of the decision

They were the real persons whom he earmarked with certainty as the ultimate recipients of his bounty,Ratio of the decision

"In express terms he conferred on his daughter powers of alienation byway of gift, exchange, sale, but in sharp contrast to this, on his widow he conferred no such powers",Ratio of the decision

The direction to her was that she should enjoy the entire properties including the outstandings etc,Ratio of the decision

and these shall thereafter pass to her daughters,Ratio of the decision

"Though no restraint in express terms was put on her powers of alienation in case of necessity, even that limited power was not given to her in express terms",Ratio of the decision

"If the testator had before his mind's eye his daughter and her heirs as the ultimate beneficiaries of his bounty, that intention could only be achieved by giving to the widow a limited estate, because by conferring a full Hindu widow's estate on her the daughter will, only have a mere spes successions under the Hindu law which may or may not mature and under the will her interest would Only be a contingent one in what was left indisposed of by the widow",Ratio of the decision

It is significant that the testator did not say in the will that the daughter will enjoy only the properties left indisposed of by the widow,Ratio of the decision

"The extent of the grant, so far as the properties mentioned in the schedule are concerned, to the daughter and the widow is the same",Ratio of the decision

Just as the widow was directed to enjoy tile entire properties mentioned in the schedule during her lifetime in like manner the daughter and her heirs were also directed to enjoy the same properties with absolute rights from generation to generation,Ratio of the decision

They could not enjoy the same properties in the manner directed if the widow had a full Hindu widow's estate and had the power for any purpose to dispose of them and did so,Ratio of the decision

"If that was the intention, the testator would clearly have said that the daughter would only take the properties remaining after the death of the widow",Ratio of the decision

"The widow cannot be held to have been given a full Hindu widow's estate under the will unless it can be said that under its terms she was given the power of alienation for necessary purposes, whether in express terms or by necessary implication",Ratio of the decision

"As above pointed out, admittedly power of alienation in express terms was not conferred on her",Ratio of the decision

"It was argued that such a power was implicit within the acts she was authorized to do, that is to say, when she was directed to pay the debts and settle the maintenance of Ramalakshmi it was implicit within these directions that for these purposes, if necessity arose, she could alienate the properties",Argument

This suggestion in the surrounding circumstances attending the execution of this will cannot be sustained,Ruling by Present Court

The properties disposed of by the will and mentioned in the schedule were considerable in extent and it seems that they fetched sufficient income to enable the widow to fulfil the obligations under the will,Ratio of the decision

Indeed we find that within four years of the death of the testator the widow was able to pay a lump sum of Rs,Ratio of the decision

"3,350 in cash to the daughter-in-law without alienating any part of the immovable properties and presumably by this time she had discharged all the debts",Ratio of the decision

"It is not shown that she alienated a single item of immovable property till the year 1945, a period of over 21 years after the death of her husband, excepting one, which she alienated in the year 1937 to raise a sum of Rs",Ratio of the decision

"1,000 in order to buy some land",Ratio of the decision

By this transaction she substituted one property by another,Ratio of the decision

"For the purpose of her maintenance, for payment of debts etc., and for settling the claim of the daughter-in-law she does not appear to have felt any necessity to make any alienation of any part of the estate mentioned in the schedule and the testator in all likelihood knew that she could fulfil these obligations without having recourse to alienations and hence he did not give her any power to do so",Ratio of the decision

In this situation the inference that the testator must have of necessity intended to confer on the widow power of alienation for those limited purposes cannot be raised,Ratio of the decision

"In our opinion, even if that suggestion is accepted that for the limited purposes mentioned in the will the widow could alienate, this power would fall far short of the powers that a Hindu widow enjoys under Hindu law",Ratio of the decision

"Under that law she has the power to alienate the estate for the benefit of the soul of the husband, for pilgrimage and for the benefit of the estate and for other authorized purposes",Ratio of the decision

"It cannot be said that a Hindu widow can only alienate her husband's estate for payment of debts, to meet maintenance charges and for her own maintenance",Ratio of the decision

She represents the estate in all respects and enjoys very wide power except that she cannot alienate except for necessity and her necessities have to be judged on a variety of considerations,Ratio of the decision

We therefore hold that the estate conferred on Ranganayaki Ammal was more like the limited estate in the English sense of the term than like a full Hindu widow's estate in spite of the directions above- mentioned,Ruling by Present Court

She had complete control over the income of the property during her lifetime,Ratio of the decision

but she had no power to deal with the corpus of the estate,Ratio of the decision

and it had to be kept intact for the enjoyment of the daughter,Ratio of the decision

Though the daughter was not entitled to immediate possession of the property it was indicated with certainty that she should get the entire estate at the proper time,Ratio of the decision

and she thus got an interest in it on the testator's death,Ratio of the decision

She was given a present right of future enjoyment in the property,Ratio of the decision

"According to Jarman (Jarman on Wills), the law leans in favour of vesting of estates and the property disposed of belongs to the object of the gift when the will takes effect and we think the daughter got under this will a vested interest in the testator's properties on his death",Ratio of the decision

"It was strenuously argued by Mr. K. S. Krishnaswami Iyengar that Lakshminarayana Iyer was a Brahmin gentleman presumably versed in the sastras, living in a village in the southernmost part of the Madras State, that his idea of a restricted estate was more likely to be one analogous to a Hindu woman's estate than a life estate a,-, understood in English law wherein the estate is measured by use and not by duration, and that if this will was construed in the light of the notions of Lakshminarayana Iyer it should be held that the widow got under it a Hindu widow's estate and the daughter got under it a contingent remainder in the nature of spes and on her death there was nothing which could devolve on the plaintiff and he thus had no locus standi to question the alienations made by the widow",Argument

The learned counsel in support of his contention drew our attention to a number of decisions of different High Courts and contended that the words of this will should be construed in the manner as more or less similar words were construed by the courts in the wills dealt with in those decisions,Argument

This rule of construction by analogy is a dangerous one to follow in construing wills differently worded and executed in different surroundings,Ratio of the decision

Vide Sasiman v. Shib Narain 491,Ratio of the decision

A. 2 5,Ratio of the decision

"However, out of respect for learned counsel on both sides who adopted the same method of approach we proceed to examine some of the important cases referred to by them",Ratio of the decision

Mr. Krishnaswami Iyengar sought to derive the greatest support for his contention from the decision in Ram Bahadur v. Jager,Precedent

Nath Prasad 3 Pat,Precedent

L. J. 199,Precedent

"The will there recited that if a daughter or son was born to the testator during his lifetime, such son or daughter would be the owner of all his properties but if there was no son or daughter, his niece S. would get a bequest of a lakh of rupees, and the rest of the movable and immovable properties would remain in possession of his wife until her death, and after her these would remain in possession of his niece",Precedent

"The remainder was disposed of in the following words: - ""If on the death of my wife and my niece there be living a son and a daughter born of the womb of my said brother's daughter, then two-thirds of the movable property will belong to the son and one-third to the daughter",Precedent

But as regards the immovable property none shall have the lest right of alienation,Precedent

They will of course be entitled to enjoy the balance left after payment of rent,Precedent

This will was construed as conveying an absolute estate to the son and the daughter of the niece,Precedent

It was remarked that in spite of an,Precedent

"express restriction against alienation, the estate taken by S. (the niece) was an estate such as a woman ordinarily acquires by inheritance under the Hindu law which she holds in a completely representative character but is unable to alienate except in case of legal necessity and that such a construction was in accordance with the ordinary notions that a Hindu has in regard to devolution of his property",Precedent

The provisions contained in this will bear no analogy to those we have to construe,Ratio of the decision

"The restraint against alienation was repugnant to both a life estate and a widow',-, estate and was not, therefore, taken into account",Ratio of the decision

But there were other indications in that will showing that a widow's estate had been given,Ratio of the decision

The fact that the gift over was a contingent bequest was by itself taken as a sure indication that the preceding bequest was that of a widow's estate,Ratio of the decision

There is no such indication in the will before us,Ratio of the decision

Reliance was next placed on the decision in Pavani Subbamma v. Ammala Rama Naidu (1937,Precedent

1 M.L.J. 268,Precedent

1936 Indlaw MAD 236,Precedent

"Under the will there dealt with, the widow S, was to enjoy the properties and after her lifetime the properties were to be taken in the ratio of three to five by the son's daughter and the daughter's son respectively",Precedent

"A suit was instituted by the son's daughter for the recovery of possession of her share in one item of property forming, part of the estate which had been sold by S",Precedent

The question for decision in that case was whether S. was at all entitled to sell anything more than her life interest even for purposes of meeting a necessity binding upon the estate,Precedent

"Varadachari J. held that since in the will the gift over to the grand-children was of the entire Properties, and not a mere gift by way of defeasance, it had to be held that it indicated that the prior gift in favour of the widow was only of a limited interest",Precedent

"This decision therefore goes against the contention of the learned counsel but he placed reliance on the observations made in the judgment when the learned Judge proceeded to say: ""In deference to the view taken in Maharaja of Kolhapur v. sundaram Iyer (1925) I.L.R. 48 Mad",Ratio of the decision

"1, it may be possible to create an interest analogous to a woman's estate in Hindu law notwithstanding the addition of a gift over and that the estate taken by S. need not necessarily be only a life estate in the English law sense of the term",Ratio of the decision

We do not understand how such passing observations can be helpful in deciding the present case,Ratio of the decision

"Assuming that it is possible to create a Hindu woman's estate not with standing the addition of a gift over, the question nevertheless whether that had been done in a given case must depend on the terms of the particular instrument under consideration",Ratio of the decision

"The following remarks in the Privy Council decision in Nathu, Ram Mahajan v. Gangayabai (1938",Precedent

"2 M.L.J. 562 were next cited:-- ""As the will gave her the right to 'enjoy' the income of the estate during her lifetime, it was evidently contemplated that she should, as provided by -the Hindu law in the case of a widow, be in possession of the estate",Precedent

Such casual observation made in respect of a will couched in entirely different terms cannot afford much assistance in the decision of the case,Ratio of the decision

In Vasantharao Ammannamma v. Venkata Kodanda Rao Pantalu 1939,Precedent

Indlaw MAD 621 (1940,Precedent

"M.L.J. 188, the next case cited, a Hindu testator who was a retired subordinate judge provided by his will as follows: ""Out, of the aforestated ancestral lands, the oneninth share to which I am entitled shall be enjoyed after my death by my wife till her death, and after her death it shall pass to S. son of my second elder brother deceased",Precedent

My self-acquired properties shall on my death be enjoyed by my wife till her death and after her death they shall pass to my daughter,Precedent

Thereafter they shall pass to my grandson through my daughter,Precedent

"The will was construed as giving the self-acquired properties ultimately to the grandsons, and the estate of the daughter was likened to an estate which she would take- under the law of inheritance, that is a limited estate analogous to a widow's estate",Precedent

"At page 193 of the report it was observed as follows: ""The question therefore arises, did he intend to confer only a life estate or a daughter's estate",Precedent

It seems to us that he meant to give a daughter's estate rather than a life estate,Precedent

He omits the words 'during her life' with reference to the disposition in favour of the daughter,Precedent

"The words 'pass to my daughter' would rather indicate that in the ordinary course of devolution the estate should pass to her, that is, the daughter and then to the grandsons",Precedent

"The words used in favour of the grandsons seem to indicate that the estate conferred on the daughter was not a life estate because there is no direct gift in favour of the grandsons, but on the other hand, what he says is that through his daughter the estate shall pass to his grandsons",Precedent

"Either he must have intended that the daughter should convey the property either by will or inter vivos to the grandsons or she having taken the estate, through her it should pass to the grandsons in the ordinary course of devolution",Precedent

"If it was the daughter's estate that was intended to be conferred, there can be no question that the estate taken by the grandsons is not a vested interest",Precedent

This line of reasoning which appealed to the learned judges is not of much he]-) to us here as the language hi this will is quite different,Ratio of the decision

"If the same line of reasoning is adopted here, the decision of the case would go against the client of Mr. K. S. K. Iyengar because in the will in this case the widow's estate is delimited by the words ""till your lifetime",Ratio of the decision

Reliance was next placed on Maharaja of Kolhapur v. sundaram Iyer (1925) I.L.R. 48 Mad,Precedent

That was a case of a government grant on the special terms set out therein and the question arose as to the nature of the grant,Precedent

"There it was said that: ""the widows of Sivaji Raja got the gift of a life estate very much resembling the ordinary estate of a Hindu widow and with all the incidents of a widow's estate except the liability to be divested, but nevertheless a life estate rather than an estate of inheritance",Precedent

These remarks do not throw much light on the point before us,Ratio of the decision

"The last decision referred to was the decision of the Privy Council in Mahomed Shumsool v. Shewukram 1874 Indlaw PC 12 (1874-75) 2 I.A. 7 There a Hindu inhabitant of Bihar by a document of a testamentary character declared his daughter who had two daughters, as his heir, and after her two daughters together with their children were declared heirs and malik",Precedent

"One daughter of the daughter predeceased the testator without issue and the other daughter died after the death of the testator leaving an only son, the respondent in that case",Precedent

"In a suit by the respondent against his grandmother the daughter of the 'testator for a declaratory order preserving unmolested his future right and title to the said lands, it was held that the daughter took an estate subject to her daughters succeeding her",Precedent

"In this judgment the following observations were emphasized as relevant to this enquiry:- ""It has been contended that these latter expressions qualify the generality of the former expressions, and that the will, taken as a whole, must be construed as intimating the intention of the testator that Mst",Precedent

"Rani Dhun Kaur should not take an absolute estate, but that she should be succeeded in her estate by her two daughters",Precedent

"In other words, that she should take an estate very much like the ordinary estate of a Hindu widow",Precedent

In construing the will of a Hindu it is not improper to take into consideration what are known to be the ordinary notions and wishes of Hindus with respect to the devolution of property,Precedent

"It may be assumed that a Hindu generally desires that an estate, especially an ancestral estate, shall be retained in his family; and it may be assumed that a Hindu knows that, as a general rule, at all events, women do not take absolute estates of inheritance which they are enabled to alienate",Precedent

These observations are unexceptionable but it may also be pointed out that it is open to a Hindu to confer a limited life estate on his widow or even a larger estate than a widow takes as an heir and that in every case he may not confer upon her by will a Hindu widow's estate which she would otherwise get by inheritance,Ratio of the decision

"Generally speaking, there will be no point in making a will if what is to be given to a widow is what she would get on intestacy and cases do arise where a Hindu wishes to give to his widow a more restricted estate than she would get on intestacy or a much larger estate than that",Ratio of the decision

The question in every case cannot be determined merely on the theory that every Hindu thinks only about a Hindu widow's estate and no more,Ratio of the decision

What is given must be gathered from the language of the will in the light of the surrounding circumstances,Ratio of the decision

The learned counsel for the respondent followed the line adopted by Mr. Krishnaswami Iyengar,Argument

He also on the analogy of other wills and the decisions given on their terms wanted a decision on the construction of this will in his favour,Argument

"In the first instance, he placed reliance on a decision of the Madras High Court in Ratna Chetty v. Narayana swami Chetty (19I4",Precedent

26 M.L.J. 616,Precedent

"There the testator made a will in favour of his wife providing, inter alia",Precedent

"all my properties shall after my death be in possession of my wife herself and she herself should be heir to everything and Mutha Arunachala Chetty (nephew) and my wife, should live together amicably as of one family",Precedent

"If the two could not agree and live together amicably, my wife would pay Rs",Precedent

"4,000 and separate him",Precedent

and then my wife would enjoy all the remaining properties with absolute rights,Precedent

"If both of them would live together amicably, Muthu Arunachala Chetty himself would enjoy the properties which remain after the death of the widow",Precedent

"It was held upon the construction of the will that the nephew, who lived amicably with the widow till his death, had a vested interest at testator's death which could not be defeated by a testamentary disposition by the widow in favour of a stranger",Precedent

This decision only decides that case and is not very relevant in this enquiry,Ratio of the decision

Reference was also made to the decision of their Lordships of the Privy Council in Mst,Precedent

Bhagwati Devi v. Chowdry Bholonath Thakur (1874-75) 2 I.A 256,Precedent

This was a case of a gift inter vivos,Precedent

The gift to Mst,Precedent

"Chunderbutti, his wife, was in these terms: ""the remaining 'milkiut' and 'minhai ' 'estates, together with the amount of ready money, articles, slaves, and all household furniture I have placed in the possession of Mst",Precedent

"Chunderbutti Thakurain, my wife, to be enjoyed during her lifetime, in order that she may hold possession of all the properties and milkiut possessed by me, the declarant, during her lifetime, and by the payment of Government revenue, appropriate the profits derived therefrom, but that she should not by any means transfer the milkiut estates and the slaves; that after the death of my aforesaid wife the milkiut and household furniture shall devolve on Girdhari Thakur, my karta (adopted son",Precedent

The subordinate judge held that Chunderbutti got an estate for life with the power to appropriate profits and Girdhari got a vested remainder on her death,Precedent

The High Court took a different view and held that Chunderbutti took the estate in her character as a Hindu widow,Precedent

"The Privy Council on this will held as follows: ""Their Lordships do not feel justified, upon mere conjecture of what might probably have been intended, in so interpreting it as materially to change the nature of the estate taken by Chunderbutti",Precedent

"If she took the estate only of a Hindu widow, one consequence, no doubt, would be that she would be unable to alienate the profits, or that at all events, whatever she purchased out of them would be an increment to her husband's estate, and the plaintiffs would be entitled to recover possession of all such property, real and personal",Precedent

"But, on the other hand, she would have certain rights as a Hindu widow; for example, she would have the right under certain circumstances, if the estate were insufficient to defray the funeral expenses or her maintenance, to alienate it altogether",Precedent

"She certainly would have the power of selling her own estate; and it would further follow that Girdhari would not be possessed in any sense of a vested remainder, but merely of a contingent one",Precedent

"It would also follow that she would completely represent the estate, and under certain circumstances the statute of limitations might run against the heirs to the estate, whoever they might be",Precedent

Their Lordships see no sufficient reason for importing into this document words which would carry with them all these consequences and they agree with the subordinate judge in construing it according to its plain meaning,Precedent

These observations have to a certain extent relevance to the present case but on the facts this case is also distinguishable,Ratio of the decision

This will was couched in different language than the will in the present case,Ratio of the decision

"There was a clear prohibition, forbidding the widow to make any transfers of the milkiuit estates and the slaves",Ratio of the decision

Reference was also made to a decision of the Bombay High Court in Lallu v. Jagmohan (1898) I.L.R,Precedent

22 Bom,Precedent

The will there ran as follows,Precedent

"When I die, my wife named Suraj' is owner of that property",Precedent

"And my wife has powers to do in the same way as I have absolute powers to do when I am present, and in case of my wife's death, my daughter Mahalaxmi is owner of the said property after that",Precedent

"It was held that Suraj took only a life estate under the will, with remainder over to Mahalaxmi after her death and the bequest to Mahalaxmi was not contingent on her surviving Suraj, but that she took a vested remainder which upon her death passed to her heirs",Precedent

"After considering the rival contentions of the parties, we are of the opinion that no sufficient grounds have been made out for disturbing the unanimous opinion of the two courts below on the construction of this will",Ruling by Present Court

Both the learned counsel eventually conceded that the language used in the will was consistent with the testator's intention of conferring a life estate in the English sense as well as with the intention of conferring a Hindu widow's estate,Ratio of the decision

"It was, however, urged by Mr. Rajah Iyer that as no express or implied power of alienation for purposes of all legal necessities was conferred on the widow, that circumstance negatived the view that the testator intended to confer upon his widow a Hindu widow's estate as she would get in case of intestacy",Argument

"He also emphasized that the words of the gift over to the daughter as supporting his construction which was further reinforced by the words of the will limiting the widow's estate "" till your lifetime "" and of the omission from therein of words such as nialik etc., while describing the widow's estate",Argument

"Mr. Krisbnaswami lyengar, on the other hand, contended that the absence of any words in the will restricting her powers of alienation and putting a restraint on them, suggested a contrary intention and that the daughter's estate was described as coming into being after the estate of the widow and was not conferred on her simultaneously with the widow, and this connoted according to the notions of Hindus a full Hindu widow's estate",Argument

"In our judgment, there is force in the contention of Mr. Rajah Iyer for reasons already stated and in the result, therefore, we dismiss this appeal with costs",Ruling by Present Court

Appeal dismissed,Ruling by Present Court

There were naught witnesses a such for the murder and for establishing the guilt of the appellant the prosecution relied entirely on circumstantial evidence.,Facts
The procession relied on the following circumstances as proving the cult of the accused :,Facts
"(1) That the accused was well acquainted with Mst.	Facts

(5) That on 21 9 1966 gold and silver ornaments belonging to Kalawati, which she had been wearing when she went to the accused's enclosure two days earlier, were recovered from a locked box in the accused's house, the key of which was produced by the accused.",Facts
"P.Ws. 1, 4, and 11 have given evidence regarding circumstance no. 1.",Facts
P.W. 1 has spoken regarding circumstance no. 2.,Facts
P. W. 8 has given evidence regarding circumstance no. 3.,Facts
"This witness has stated that he saw on the evening of September 19, 1966 Kalawati in the company of the appellant and his associate Kripal.",Facts
"It may be stated that this was the last occasion when Kalawati was seen alive by any of the witnesses, because, on the next morning her dead body was found in the well.",Facts
"Circumstance no. 4 is spoken to by P.W. 1, her husband P. W. 4 and P.W. 7.",Facts
"The last circumstance, viz., the recovery of the ornaments belonging to the deceased on September 21, 1966 is spoken to by the two police officers, P. Ws. 14 and 17, as well as by P.W 6 who was one of the Panch witnesses of recovery, under Exhibit Ka 2, on September 21, 1966.",Facts
"Both the learned Sessions Judge, as well as the High Court on appeal, have accepted as true the evidence of the witnesses, referred to above, and have further held that the five circumstances, relied on by the prosecution, have been fully established.",Ruling by Lower Court
"Taking all the circumstances together in conjunction with the denial of the accused, the High Court, in agreement with the learned Sessions Judge, has become to the conclusion that it is the appellant who murdered Kalawati, robbed her of her ornaments and disposed of her body by throwing it into the well.",Ruling by Lower Court
"Mr. Nuruddin Ahmed, learned for the appellant, has urged two contentions : (i) that the finding regarding recovery of ornaments at the instance of the appellant, recorded by the learned Session Judge and the High Court, is perverse and that no reasonable person can come to that conclusion, on the evidence on record and (ii) that even if the recovery of ornaments at the instance of the appellant, is accepted as true, it does not lead to the conclusion that it is the appellant who committed the murder.",Argument
We are satisfied that neither of these contentions can be accepted.,Ratio of the decision
The conviction of the appellant in this case is based upon circumstantial evidence and the High Court and the Sessions Judge have accepted as true the evidence of the witnesses who speak to the various circumstances relied on by the prosecution.,Ratio of the decision
"When there are concurrent findings on facts, this Court does not, normally, taken upon itself the task of again reviewing the evidence; but, in view of the aback that the finding regarding recovery of ornaments is perverse, we have ourselves gone through to he evidence bearing on that aspect, and we are satisfied, notwithstanding certain minor discrepancies, that the evidence relating to the same is true and has been rightly accepted by the learned Sessions Judge and High Court.",Ratio of the decision
"The production of ornaments by the appellant, after his arrest, and which ornaments have been identified as belonging to the deceased, is a very strong circumstance in the chain of circumstances relied on by the prosecution.",Ratio of the decision
"The evidence relating to recovery of ornaments is furnished by the two police officers, P. Ws. 14 and 17 and the Panch witness P.W. 6.",Ratio of the decision
"According to this evidence, the appellant was arrested on September 21, 1966 by P.W. 14 and the appellant agreed to produce the ornaments of Kalawati which he had kept in his house.",Ratio of the decision
"The appellant took the place officers, P.W. 6 and one Bishamber Dayal to his house and, after opening the locked box which was in a room upstairs, he produced six gold bangles, four gold ear rings, one gold ear top and four silver lachchas.",Ratio of the decision
"These articles have been identified by P. Ws. 1, 2 and 10 as belonging to the deceased.",Ratio of the decision
These witnesses have spoken to the fact that these ornaments were normally worn by Kalawati.,Ratio of the decision
Minor discrepancies in the evidence of the witnesses regarding the recovery of the ornaments have been adverted to by the High Court.,Ratio of the decision
"Quite rightly, in the opinion, the High Court has taken the view that these discrepancies do not cast any doubt regarding the truth of the ornaments having been produced by the appellant after his arrest.",Ratio of the decision
Therefor we cannot accept the contention of Mr. Nuruddin Ahmed that the finding regarding the recovery of the ornaments at the instance of the appellant is perverse.,Ratio of the decision
"On the other hand, we are satisfied that the said finding properly and legitimately followed from the acceptance of the evidence of the two police officers and P W. 6.",Ratio of the decision
"No doubt, the mere recovery of the ornaments if it had stood by itself, without any other circumstance, may not lead to the one and only conclusion that it is the appellant who committed the murder.",Ratio of the decision
"But the prosecution has relied on for other circumstances, referred to above, and those circumstances, taken along with the circumstance regarding the recovery of the ornaments in our opinion, lead to the conclusion that it was the appellant who has committed the murder of Kalawati.",Ratio of the decision
The mode of evaluating circumstantial evidence has been stated by this Court in Hanumant vs the State of Madhya Pradesh and is as follows :,Precedent
"It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature, the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should in the first instance be fully established, and all the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused.	Precedent
Again, the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency and they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved.	Precedent
In other words, there must be a chain of evidence so far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and it just be such as to show that within all human probability the act must have been done by the accused.",Precedent
This principle has been reiterated by this Court in several later decisions.,Ratio of the decision
"Applying the above principles, it is clear from the findings of the two Courts, that the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt of the appellant is to be drawn have been fully established, and the chain of evidence accepted by both the Courts is also complete and does not leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the appellant.",Ratio of the decision
"Kalawati was last seen in the company of the appellant in his Gher on the evening of September 19, 1966 and the appellant has also deliberately attempted to mislead the tenants of Kalawati's house by stating that she had gone to the village of Garthi along with Kripal.",Ratio of the decision
"After his arrest, the production, by the appellant, of the ornaments worn by Kalawati is a vary clinching circumstance, which, taken along with the other circumstances, proves the complicity of the appellant in the murder of Kalawati.",Ratio of the decision
"To conclude, the appellant has been rightly convicted and sentenced for offences under Section 302, 201, read with Ss. 34 and 394, I.P.C. The appeal fails and is dismissed.",Ruling by Present Court
Appeal Dismissed.,Ruling by Present Court
"This appeal is brought by special leave from the award of the industrial tribunal, Bihar, dated 15 September, 1967.",Facts
"The appellant Tatanagar Foundry Company, Ltd., is incorporated in the State of West Bengal and owns two manufacturing establishments, one located at Belur in the State of West Bengal and the other in Jamshedpur in Bihar.",Facts
"The appellant carried on its business at Belur but has now closed its business at Jamshedpur with effect from 20 November, 1966.",Facts
"At the time of the closure the appellant employed 1, 360 workmen in its Jamshedpur establishment where it was producing cast iron pipes, specials and heavy grey iron castings including ingots, moulds, etc.",Facts
"On 20 September 1966, the appellant issued a notice in respect of its business at Jamshedpur that due to shortage of orders and other economic reasons, about 120 workmen are being retrenched and the Commissioner of Labour, Government of Bihar, Patna, was duly notified of the said retrenchment.",Facts
"On 22 September, 1966, the Labour Superintendent, Government of Bihar, Jamshedpur, held conciliation proceedings at which the appellant agreed to retain the services of fourteen of the retrenched workmen and the union agreed to the retrenchment of the remaining workmen.",Facts
"On or about 12 October, 1966, by a notice of the same date, the appellant desired to retrench about 400 workmen, but at the intervention of the Superintendent of Labour, the notice was temporarily withdrawn with a view to discuss the matter with the union.",Facts
Accordingly a meeting was fixed on 21 October 1966 between the appellant and the union at Jamshedpur but the said meeting could not take place.,Facts
"On 29 October, 1966, the appellant by a notice laid off nearly 600 workmen for want of supplies of good quality raw materials.",Facts
"In a letter dated 8 November 1966, the Superintendent of Labour, Jamshedpur, wrote that the general secretary of the union had put up a proposal for running the Jamshedpur establishment of the appellant on a co operative basis and requested Sri G. D. Agarwalla, director of the appellant, to place the matter before the board of directors of the appellant.",Facts
"At their meeting on 17 November, 1966, the board of directors considered the letter dated 8 November, 1966 of the Labour Superintendent and resolved that if the State Government should be desirous of running the Jamshedpur plant on a co operative basis Sri G. D. Agarwalla was authorized to conduct negotiations with the State Government of Bihar.",Facts
But no further communication was received from the Government of Bihar indicating its willingness or intention to run the Jamshedpur branch of the appellant.,Facts
"At its meeting on 17 November, 1966, the board of directors of the appellants considered the situation in the Jamshedpur plant and decided that it should be closed as early as possible and Sri Agarwalla was authorized to take necessary steps to effect the closure.",Facts
"Pursuant to the decision of the board of directors Sri Agarwalla issued a notice dated 19 November, 1966.",Facts
"By the said notice the workmen of the appellant were informed of its decision to close the business at Jamshedpur for good with effect from 21 November, 1966 for the reasons explained in the notice.",Facts
"All the workmen were also informed that their services were no longer required after 21 November, 1966 and the workers should consider themselves as discharged with effect from the said date.",Facts
"On 3 February 1967, the Government of Bihar referred the following dispute to the industrial tribunal, Bihar, for adjudication under section 10(1)(d) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (14 of 1947)",Statute
"Whether the closure of the Tatanagar Foundry Company, Ltd., Jamshedpur, is justified ? If not, to what relief, and compensation the workmen are entitled?",Ratio of the decision
"By its award, dated 15 September, 1967, the industrial tribunal held that it was satisfied that the closure of the Jamshedpur business of the appellant was not a closure but a lookout in the disguise of a closure and directed the reinstatement of the workmen with full wages for the period they have been out of employment.",Ruling by Lower Court
In support of this appeal it was argued in the first place that the industrial tribunal had no jurisdiction to go into the question whether the closure of the Jamshedpur business was justified or not for financial or other reasons.,Argument
"The contention was that the tribunal having found that the factory had in fact closed down, it had no jurisdiction to go into the question whether the closure could have been avoided.",Argument
"In our opinion, the argument is well founded and must be accepted as correct.",Ratio of the decision
"The distinction between a lockout and a closure has been explained by the decision of this Court in Express Newspapers, Ltd., vs Their workers and staff and other 1962 Indlaw SC 28 ].",Precedent
"It was pointed out in that case that in the case of a closure, the employer does not merely close down the place of business but he closes the business itself finally and irrevocably.",Precedent
A lockout on the other hand indicates the closure of the place of business and not closure of the business itself.,Precedent
In the present case the totality of facts and circumstances would lead to the conclusion that the undertaking at Jamshedpur was closed down completely and was a final and irrecoverable termination of the business itself.,Ratio of the decision
But the tribunal has come to a finding that the closure of the business was not bona fide but the closure was done in order to victimize the workmen.,Ruling by Lower Court
"As regards the financial position, the tribunal took the view that on the whole the financial condition of the company in 1966 has not worsened to such an extent as to reasonably constitute a good ground for closing the business altogether.",Ruling by Lower Court
It might have been a ground for reorganizing the company or rationalizing it by retrenchment or otherwise but it could not be a ground for winding up the business altogether.,Ratio of the decision
"In our opinion, the finding of the tribunal on this point is defective in law.",Ratio of the decision
It is now established that in the case of a closure the employer does not merely close down the place of business but he closes the business finally and irrevocably.,Ratio of the decision
The closure has to be genuine and bona fide in the sense that it should be a closure in fact and not a mere pretence of closure.,Ratio of the decision
"Taking into account the entire set of circumstances and facts in the present case, we are of opinion that there has been in fact a closure of the Jamshedpur business and the finding of the tribunal that there was a lockout is defective in law and must be set aside.",Ruling by Present Court
The next question is whether workmen were entitled to compensation under S.25FFF of the Industrial Disputes Act which states :,Ratio of the decision
"(1) Where an undertaking is closed down for any reason whatsoever, every workman who has been in continuous service for not less than one year in that undertaking immediately before such closure shall, subject to the provisions of Sub sec. (2), be entitled to notice and compensation in accordance with the provisions of section 25F, as if the workman had been retrenched;	Ratio of the decision
Provided that where the undertaking is closed down on account of unavoidable circumstances beyond the control of the employer, the compensation to be paid to the workman under Cl. (b) of section 25F shall not exceed his average pay for three months.	Ruling by Present Court
Explanation.	Ratio of the decision
An undertaking which is closed down by reason merely of financial difficulties (including financial losses) or accumulation of undisposed of stocks or the expiry of the period of the lease or the licence granted to it where the period of the lease or the licence expires on or after 1 April, 1967 shall not be deemed to have been closed down on account of unavoidable circumstances beyond the control of the employer within the meaning of the proviso to this sub section.",Ratio of the decision
The tribunal has found that the appellant was not right in its contention that the closure was due to unavoidable circumstances beyond its control.,Ratio of the decision
According to the appellant the main reasons for the closure are :,Ratio of the decision
(1) financial condition of the appellant;,Ratio of the decision
(2) non availability of orders for supply of goods; and,Ratio of the decision
(3) non co operation from the workmen in standardization of the working force and for reduction of the high percentage of rejection.,Ratio of the decision
The tribunal has gone into the oral and documentary evidence adduced by the parties and reached the conclusion that the closure of the business was not due to unavoidable circumstances beyond the control of the appellant.,Ratio of the decision
We see no reason for interfering with the finding of the tribunal on this aspect of the case.,Ratio of the decision
"The result, therefore, is that the workmen are entitled to compensation under the main clause of S.25FFF of the Industrial Disputes Act,1947.",Ruling by Present Court

"The question involved in this case is whether the High Court of Calcutta was right in returning the plaint presented by the appellant for presentation to the proper Court under Order 7 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Code').",Ratio of the decision
"The appellant is the owner of Flat no. 2 (now known as 'F'), 7th Floor, Gem Building at 5/B, Russel Street, Calcut ta.",Facts
"The said premises had been leased out in favour of the respondent on a monthly rent of Rs, 1,400.",Facts
"The respondent committed default in the payment of rent from the month of June, 1984.",Facts
"The appellant, therefore, served a notice on the respondent under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and section 13(6) of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') determining the tenancy with the expiry of the month of January, 1985 and called upon him to deliver possession of the premises.",Statute
"Upon failure of the respondent to hand over the vacant possession of the premises on the expiry of January, 1985 the appellant filed a suit in Suit no. 755 of 1985 on the Original Side of the High Court of Calcutta for recovery of possession of the premises and for recovery of arrears of rent amounting to rs. 11,200 and of Rs.78,000 by way of mesne profits/damages, claiming mesne profits/damages at the rate of Rs.7,800 per month from 1st February, 1985 until 30th November, 1985.",Facts
"The appellant valued the suit for purposes of court fee and jurisdiction at rs. 1,06,000 which was arrived at as follows:",Facts
"Any suit, the value of which was above rs. 1,00,000, had to be filed in the High Court on its Original Side.",Facts
"Accord ingly, the plaint was presented in the High Court after paying the necessary court fee on the basis of the above valuation.",Facts
"After the respondent was served with the summons in the suit, he made an application before the High Court for taking the plaint off its file and for returning it to the appellant for filing the same in the proper court.",Facts
"The respondent stated in the application that on a plain reading of the definition of the expression 'tenant in the Act, the respondent continued to be the tenant even after the termi nation of his contractual tenancy and did not become an unauthorised occupant of the accommodation and he was, therefore, liable to pay rent at the rate of Rs, 1400 per month till the date of the suit.",Facts
"He further stated that calculated on the above basis, the respondent would be liable to pay rs. 14,000 only by way of arrears of rent for the period between 1st February, 1985 and 30th November, 1985 instead of Rs.78,000 claimed by the appellant by way of mesne profits/ damages for the said period.",Facts
"The respondent contended that the valuation of the suit for purposes of jurisdiction would be Rs.42,000 only and that the value of the suit being less than rs. 1,00,000 it had to be filed in the City Civil Court of Calcutta.",Facts
"The respondent, therefore, prayed that the plaint should be returned for presentation to the proper court by virtue of section 15 of the Code which provided that every suit should be instituted in the court of the lowest grade competent to try it.",Ratio of the decision
The learned Judge on hearing the above application accepted the plea of the respondent that under the provisions of the Act the expression 'tenant' included a person continuing in posses sion of the accommodation even after the termination of his contractual tenancy and on such termination the possession of a tenant did not become wrongful.,Ruling by Lower Court
"The learned Judge, therefore, held that the appellant was not entitled to claim mesne profits/damages at the rate of Rs.7,800 per month from 1st February, 1985 to 30th November, 1985 aggregating to Rs.78,000 but was entitled to recover rs. 14,000 only at the rate of rs. 1,400 per month in respect of that period.",Ruling by Lower Court
"The learned Judge found that the suit should have been valued at Rs.42,000 and not at rs. 1,06,000 and that the High Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the said suit.",Ruling by Lower Court
"Accordingly, the learned Judge directed that the plaint should be re turned to the appellant for presentation to the proper court.",Ruling by Lower Court
"Aggrieved by the decision of the learned Judge, the appellant has filed the above appeal by special leave before this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution.",Ratio of the decision
"Under section 15 of the Code every plaint should be instituted in the court of the lowest grade competent to try it and if the value of the suit was Rs.42,000 only it had to be filed in the City Civil Court of Calcutta and not on the Original Side of the High Court.",Statute
The principles which regulate the pecuniary jurisdic tion of civil courts are wellsettled.,Ratio of the decision
"Ordinarily, the valua tion of a suit depends upon the reliefs claimed therein and the plaintiff's valuation in his plaint determines the Court in which it can be presented.",Ratio of the decision
It is also true that the plaintiff cannot invoke the jurisdiction of a court by either grossly over valuing or grossly under valuing a suit.,Ratio of the decision
The Court always has the jurisdiction to prevent the abuse of the process of law.,Ratio of the decision
Under rule 10 of Order 7 of the Code the plaint can be returned at any stage of the suit for presentation to the court in which the suit should have been instituted.,Statute
The question for consideration in this case is whether in the present case the plaint has been grossly over valued with the object of bringing it within the juris diction of the High Court.,Ratio of the decision
"When the suit is filed for the recovery of money, the amount claimed has to be included in determining the value of the suit.",Ratio of the decision
"In the instant case the appellant has claimed a decree for Rs.78,000 (at the rate of Rs.7,800 per month) for the period between 1st February, 1985 and 30th November, 1985 on the footing that the re spondent's possession was unauthorised or illegal and he was liable to pay mesne profits or damages.",Ratio of the decision
"The question whether the appellant would be entitled to a decree for mesne prof its/ damages at the rate of Rs.7,800 per month or at any other rate after the termination of the tenancy is a matter which has to be decided in the suit.",Ratio of the decision
"If ultimately it is found that the appellant is not entitled to get mesne prof its or damages for the period subsequent to 1st February, 1985 and that she is only entitled to receive rs. 1,400 per month, the suit in respect of the claim over and above rs. 1,400 per month, will have to be dismissed.",Ratio of the decision
"But the question whether she was entitled to claim mesne profits or damages in respect of the period subsequent to 1st February, 1985 could not have been disposed of at a preliminary stage even before the trial had commenced.",Ratio of the decision
That question has to be decided at the conclusion of the trial along with other issues arising in the suit.,Ratio of the decision
Having regard to some of the decisions on which reliance is placed by the appellant in the course of the appeal we are of the view that the matter is not free from doubt.,Ratio of the decision
The claim for mesne profits/ damages is neither palpably absurd nor imaginary.,Ratio of the decision
It needs judicial consideration.,Ratio of the decision
The acceptance of the view put forward by the respondent may lead to encouraging a tenant who has forfeit ed his right to the tenancy to carry on a dilatory litiga tion without compensating the landlord suitably for the loss suffered by him on account of the unreasonable deprivation of the possession of his premises over a long period until he is able to get possession of the premises through the Court.,Ratio of the decision
"We cannot, therefore, state at this stage that the claim for mesne profits/damages had been made without good faith and with the sole object of instituting the said suit before the High Court of Calcutta even though it had no jurisdiction to try it.",Ratio of the decision
"We do not agree with the submission made on behalf of the respondent that the appellant had ""dishonestly and intentionally inflated the value of the suit in order to invite the jurisdiction of a particular court which has no jurisdiction otherwise."" If mesne profits/damages are found to be payable then the claim made at the rate of Rs.7,800 per month for a premises of the nature in question which is situated in Calcutta does not appear to be fanciful having regard to the prevailing situation.",Ratio of the decision
We however express no opinion on the Actual amount that may be awarded as mesne profits/damages in the event of the liability to pay it being established.,Ratio of the decision
We are of the view that on the facts and in the circum stances of the case the High Court was in error in prejudg ing the issue relating to the right of the appellant to claim mesne profits/damages and in directing that the plaint should be returned for presentation to the proper court.,Ruling by Present Court
"We, therefore, set aside the order passed by the High Court and direct the High Court to proceed with the hearing of the suit.",Ruling by Present Court
"We also direct that the observations made by the learned Judge in the course of the order against which this appeal is filed regarding the right of the appellant to claim the mesne profits/damages at the rate of Rs.7,800 per month shall not be binding on the parties and that the said question shall be decided afresh by the High Court in the course of the trial.",Ruling by Present Court
"We, however, express no opinion on the correctness or otherwise of the observations made by the learned Judge on the above question.",Ruling by Present Court

Respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court of Madras seeking a direction to the petitioner to apply the rule of reservation to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in respect of those seats which are set apart for All India Pool in the M.B.B.S. or B.D.S. list.,Ratio of the decision
"He had applied specifically in the category of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe for the All India Pre medical Entrance Examination, 1999.",Facts
"However, when the results were published, he found that no separate list had been published in respect of that category.",Facts
"He contended that there is a constitutional obligation to provide a special reservation to the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes in the all India quota as otherwise, it would be violation of Article 15 (4) of the Constitution of India.",Facts
He sought for a direction to apply the rule of reservation.,Facts
"A learned single Judge of the High Court held that the seats that are made available from various States are normally subject to the rule of reservation and the 15% of the seats allowed to the all India quota would, in the ordinary circumstances, have been reserved for the scheduled caste and schedule tribe candidates but for the directions of this Court under a scheme.",Ruling by Lower Court
"He also noticed that there is no specific order of this Court not to apply the reservation rule to all India quota which is provided only to overcome the difficulty of residential requirement and, therefore, these seats must also provide for reservation on the ground of social and economic backwardness in terms of Article 15 (4) and the directives principles of State policy.",Ruling by Lower Court
"Thus, he allowed the writ petition directing to set apart and reserve seats for the socially and educationally backward classes as per the policy of the Government making it clear that out of the 15% of the seats allocated, there should be reservation for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.",Ruling by Lower Court
"Against that order, a writ appeal was preferred by the petitioner herein with an application seeking interim order for stay of the judgment of the learned single Judge.",Facts
"A limited interim order was granted to the effect that if the 15% reservation is notionally implemented and the first respondent is found eligible to get admission under that quota, he should be given admission.",Ruling by Lower Court
It is against this order this special leave petition is filed.,Facts
"Considering the nature of the matter and the issues involved in the case, the learned counsel on both sides agreed that we should transfer the writ appeal that had been filed and dispose of the same on merits instead of merely considering the appeal against the interim order made on the interlocutory application.",Ratio of the decision
"Hence, we proceed to transfer under Article 139A the writ appeal (filed in the High Court) to this Court and dispose of the same by this order.",Statute
"In Dr. Dinesh Kumar and others (II) vs Motilal Nehru Medical College, Allahabad and others, JT 1986 (2) SC 97 1986 Indlaw SC 178, the question of 15% of the total seats being made available for admission to M.B.B.S. or B.D.S. course without taking into account any reservation made by the State Government was considered in the following manner :",Precedent
"Firstly, it was contended that the suggestion that 15 per cent of the total seats available for admission to M.B.B.S./B.D.S. course without taking into account any reservations which may be made by the State Government, would tend to produce inequality of opportunity for admission to students in different States since the percentage of reservations varied from State to State and	Precedent
secondly, it was urged that the proposal of the Government of India that valid reservations should not exceed 50 per cent of the total number of seats available for admission, will reduce the opportunities which were at present available to scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and backward classes as a result of reservations exceeding 50 per cent of the total seats made in some of the States and particularly in the State of Tamil Nadu, where the reservations exceed 68 per cent.	Precedent
We agree with the second objection raised on behalf of some of the State Governments but so far as the first objection is concerned, we do not think it is well founded.	Precedent
There can be no doubt that if in each State, 30 per cent of the seats were to be made available for admission on the basis of All India Entrance Examination after taking into account reservations validly made, the number of seats which would be available for admission on the basis of All India Entrance Examination would vary inversely with the percentage of reservations validly made in that State.	Precedent
If the percentage of reservations is high as in the State of Tamil Nadu or the State of Karnataka, the number of seats available for admission on the basis of All India Entrance Examination would be relatively less than what would be in a State where the percentage of reservations is low.	Precedent
There would thus be total inequality in the matter of making available seats for admission on the basis of All India Entrance Examination.	Precedent
It would be open to a State Government to reduce the number of seats available for admission on the basis of All India Entrance Examination by increasing the number of reserved categories or by increasing the percentage of reservations.	Precedent
We, therefore, agree with the Government of India that the formula adopted by us in our main judgment dated June 22, 1984, for determining the number of seats which should be made available for admission on the basis of All India Entrance Examination should be changed.	Precedent
We would direct, in accordance with the suggestion made in the scheme by the Government of India, that not less than 15 per cent of the total number of seats in each medical college or institution, without taking into account any reservations validly made, shall be filled on the basis of All India Entrance Examination.	Precedent
This new formula is, in our opinion, fair and just and brings about real equality of opportunity in admissions to the M.B.B.S./B.D.S. course without placing the students in one State in an advantageous or disadvantageous position as compared to the students in another State.	Precedent
The same formula must apply also in regard to admissions to the postgraduate courses and instead of making available for admission on All India basis, 50 per cent of the open seats after taking into account reservations validly made, we would direct that not less than 25 per cent of the total number of seats without taking into account any reservations, shall be made available for being filled on the basis of All India Entrance Examination.	Precedent
This suggestion of the Government of India deserves to be accepted and the objection to it must be overruled.",Precedent
(Emphasis supplied),Ratio of the decision
"In respect of undergraduate course, the scheme works out like this.",Ratio of the decision
"If a State has a total of 100 seats and in that State, 15% of the seats are reserved for scheduled castes and 10% for scheduled tribes, State will fill up 15% seats for scheduled caste candidates and 10% for scheduled tribe candidates, of the remaining 75 seats, 60 seats will be filled by the State Government as un reserved and 15 seats will be earmarked for all India quota.",Ratio of the decision
"Inasmuch as 15% all India quota has been earmarked under the scheme framed by this Court and that scheme itself provides the manner in which the same should be worked out, we do not think, it would be appropriate to travel outside the said provisions to find out whether a person in the position of the petitioner would be entitled to plead in the manner sought for because each of the States could also provide for reservation for scheduled caste and schedule tribe category in respect of 85% of the seats available with them.",Ratio of the decision
"If we meddle with this quota fixed, we are likely to land in innumerable and insurmountable difficulties.",Ratio of the decision
"Each State will have different categories of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and Central Government may have a different category and hence, adjustment of seats would become difficult.",Ratio of the decision
"The direction fixing 15% quota for all India basis takes note of reservations and hence, the High Court need not have made any further directions.",Ratio of the decision
"In Ajit Singh and others (II) vs State of Punjab and others, 2000 (1) AWC 574 (SC) : JT 1999 (7) SC 153 1999 Indlaw SC 627, this Court held that Article 16 (4) of the Constitution confers a discretion and does not create any constitutional duty and obligation.",Precedent
"Language of Article 15 (4) is identical and the view in Comptroller and Auditor General of India, Gian Prakash vs Jagannathan, 1986 (2) SCC 679 1986 Indlaw SC 806 and Superintending Engineer, Public Health vs Kuldeep Singh, JT 1997 (2) SC 508 1997 Indlaw SC 2284, that a mandamus can be issued either to provide for reservation or for relaxation is not correct and runs counter to judgments of earlier Constitution Benches and, therefore, these two judgments cannot be held to be laying down the correct law.",Precedent
"In these circumstances, neither the respondent in the present case could have sought for a direction nor the High Court could have granted the same.",Ratio of the decision
"Hence, we allow the writ appeal transferred to this Court and set aside order made in the writ petition.",Ruling by Present Court

"The Civil Revision petitions in proceedings under Order 34 Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (in short the 'Code') were dismissed by a common judgment dated 02 June 1997.",Facts
"Factual position, which is practically undisputed need to be noted in brief.",Ratio of the decision
The decrees for sale in the above cases were passed on 08 February 1989 and 30 July 1985 respectively.,Facts
"At the time of passing the decrees in the case, amendments as applicable to the State of Kerala were in force.",Facts
"The amendment stood repealed by virtue of section 97(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976 (Act 104 of 1976)(in short the 'Amendment Act') which came into force on 01 February 1977.",Ratio of the decision
"By an amendment effected section 122 of the Code, by the High Court of Kerala, Order 34 of the Code as existed before 01 February 1977 was incorporated in the Code with effect from 20 November 1990.",Ratio of the decision

The High Court held that the petitions under Order 34 Rule 5 were not maintainable on two grounds namely.,Ruling by Lower Court
"U/s. 60 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (in short the 'Act') right to redemption continues to inhere in a mortgage only until it is extinguished by act of parties or by a decree of Court.",Ratio of the decision
"By the passing of a decree, the mortgage security merges in the decree and is replaced by the security of the order of sale.",Ratio of the decision
Accordingly the right of redemption is extinguished by the final decree under Order 34 Rule 5(3) of Code.,Ratio of the decision
Reliance was placed on a decis ion of the Patna High Court in Sheo Narain Sah vs Mt. Deolchan Kuer (AIR 1943 Patna 208).,Argument
"Though a right under Order 34 Rule 5 was available under the Code, after the substitution of Order XXXIV by the Kerala amendment there is no such right available to the Mortgagor.",Ratio of the decision
Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the High Court's view is clearly untenable.,Argument
"First, the Kerala amendment became non est. because of the Amendment Act.",Ratio of the decision
"Secondly, the view expressed by the Patna High Court was not approved by this Court.",Ratio of the decision
"Learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand submitted that it was commonly believed that the Kerala amendment introduced on 15 January 1974 was in force at all times and the fresh amendment done in November, 1990 was just by way of clarification that it was effective till the amendment.",Argument
"High Court has held that by the passing of the decree for sale, the mortgage debt is merged into the decree and thereafter right to redemption is not available.",Ratio of the decision
"In taking that view, the High Court has relied on the decision of the Patna High Court in Sheo Narayan's case (supra).",Ratio of the decision
The view taken by the Patna High Court was held to be not the correct view as observed by this Court in Mhadagonda Ramgonda Patil and Ors. vs Shripal Balwant Rainade & Ors. (1988 (3) SCC 298 1988 Indlaw SC 456).,Precedent
It was held that unless and until a decree of order debarring the mortgagor from redeeming the property is passed under Sub Rule 3(a) of Rule 8 of Order XXXIV the right of redemption is available.,Precedent
It was inter alia held as follows:,Precedent
It is thus manifestly clear that the right of redemption will be extinguished (1) by the act of the parties or (2) by the decree of a court.,Precedent
We are not concerned with the question of extinguishment of the right of redemption by the act of the parties.,Precedent
The question is whether by the preliminary decree or final decree passed in the earlier extinguished.,Precedent
"The decree that is referred to in the proviso to section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act is a final decree in a suit for foreclosure, as provided in sub rule (2) of Rule 3 of Order 34 and a final decree in a redemption suit as provided in Order 34, Rule 8(3)(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure.",Precedent
"Sub rule (2) of Rule 3, inter alia, provides that where payment in accordance with sub rule (1) has not been made, the court shall, on an application made by the plaintiff in this behalf, pass a final decree declaring that the defendant and all persons claiming through or under him are debarred from all right to redeem the mortgaged property and also, if necessary, ordering the defendant to put the plaintiff in possession of the property.",Precedent
"Thus, in a final decree in a suit for foreclosure, on the failure of the defendant to pay all amounts due, the extinguishment of the right of redemption has to be specifically declared.",Precedent
"Again, in a final decree in a suit for redemption of mortgage by conditional sale or for redemption of an anomalous mortgage, the extinguishment of the right of redemption has to be specifically declared, as provided in clause (a) of sub rule (3) of Rule 8 of Order 34 of the Code of Civil Procedure.",Ratio of the decision
"These are the two circumstances (1) a final decree in a suit for foreclosure under Order 34, Rule 3(2); and (2) a final decree in a suit for redemption under Order 34, Rule 8(3)(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure when the right of redemption is extinguished.",Ratio of the decision
"In the instant case, the earlier suit was not a suit for foreclosure nor was either of the mortgages, a mortgage by conditional sale or an anomalous mortgage and, accordingly, there was no declaration in the final decree passed in the earlier suit for redemption that the respondents would be debarred from all right to redeem the mortgaged property.",Ratio of the decision
Rule 5(1) of Order 34 expressly recognized the right of the mortgagor to redeem the mortgage at any time before the confirmation of a sale made in pursuance of a final decree passed in a suit for sale.,Ratio of the decision
"Similarly, Rule 8(1) of Order 34 permits the mortgagor to redeem the mortgaged property before the confirmation of the sale held in pursuance of a final decree in a redemption suit, unless such final decree debars the mortgagor from all right to redeem the mortgaged property which, as noticed earlier, is provided for in sub rule (3)(a) of Rule 8 of Order 34 relating to a mortgage by conditional sale or an anomalous mortgage.",Ratio of the decision
"Thus, the provisions of Order 34 have laid down in clear terms the circumstances when the right of redemption of the mortgagor would stand extinguished.",Ratio of the decision
"It is also clear that in a suit for redemption, a mortgage other than a mortgage by conditional sale or an anomalous mortgage, the mortgagor has a right of redemption even after the sale has taken place pursuant to the final decree, but before the confirmation of such sale.",Ratio of the decision
"In view of these provisions, the question of merger of mortgage debt in the decretal debt does not at all arise.",Ratio of the decision
"We are, therefore, of the view that the decision in Sheo Narain case in so far as it lays down the merger of the mortgage debt in the decretal debt and the consequent extinguishment of the right of redemption of the mortgagor after the passing of the final decree in a suit for redemption is erroneous.""",Ratio of the decision
"As there is no such final decree in this case, the right of the mortgagor to redeem the property is available to him till the confirmation of the sale in pursuance to the decree.",Ratio of the decision
"The High Court further held that the right of redemption provided for under Order XXXIV Rule 5 is not available to the appellants in view of the fact that by the time the applications were filed, the Code as amended by substituting Order XXXIV do not contain a similar provision with effect from 20 November 1990.",Ratio of the decision
This view is also not correct.,Ratio of the decision
The decrees in the case were passed at a time when the Code was in force in the State of Kerala and the amendment in 1974 so far as the State of Kerala is concerned was not operative.,Ratio of the decision
Composite decrees were passed in both under order XXXIV Rule 4 and 5 together.,Ratio of the decision
"Those were the provisions in regard to enforcement of mortgages, and whatever may be the wording of the decree, they shall be deemed to be passed under Order XXXIV Rule 5 as it stood at the time of the passing of the decree.",Ratio of the decision
It is not necessary that all the clauses mentioned in the provisions under which the decree is passed should be incorporated in the decree.,Ratio of the decision
"While interpreting such a decree, it must be read as if all the provisions therein are incorporated in the decree.",Ratio of the decision
"The Court may not at the time of passing of the decree, be aware as to which contingency will happen in future.",Ratio of the decision
Each of the decrees was under Order XXXIV Rule 5 of the Code as it stood before 20 November 1990.,Ratio of the decision
"The effect of section 97(1) of the Amendment Act is that all the local amendments made to any of the provisions of the Code either by a State Legislature or by a High Court which were inconsistent with the Code as amended by the Amendment Act stood repealed irrespective of the fact whether the corresponding provision of the Code had been amended or modified by the Amendment Act and that was subject only to what was found in sub section (2) of Section 97. (See Ganpat Giri vs IInd Additional District Judge, Balia and Ors. (AIR 1986 SC 589 1986 Indlaw SC 313).",Precedent
"That being so, till 20 November 1990, the Kerala amendment was not effective from 01 February 1977.",Ratio of the decision
While considering a case interpreting Order XX Rule 12 of the Code in Chittoori Subbanna Vs.,Precedent
Kudappa Subbanna (AIR 1965 SC 1325 1964 Indlaw SC 231) this Court laid down the principles to be followed in interpreting such decrees when the decree has not specifically mentioned all the clauses in the provision under which the decree is passed.,Precedent
Right of redemption of a mortgage is a substantive right of Mortgagor which has accrued to him to be exercised under Order XXXIV Rule 5 of the Code when the decree was passed which cannot be taken away by the amendment of order XXXIV of the Code which was made only after the decree in this case.,Precedent
"An application under Order XXXIV Rule 5 is maintainable until the final determination of proceedings to set aside the sale under Order XXXIV either by way of appeal or revision.

"In C.A. 1488 89 of 2000 proceedings under order XXI Rule 90 were pending and they were finally decided in C.M.A 353 of 1995 by order dated 02 June 1997, along with the main order.",Ratio of the decision
In C.A. No.1490 91 of 2000 proceedings under Order 21 Rule 89 to set aside the sale was finally decided only by the order dated 02 June 1997 in C.M.A. 18 of 1993 and the application under Order 34 Rule 5 was filed earlier.,Ratio of the decision

The said dispute was referred for its determination before the Industrial Tribunal.,Facts
"The Industrial Tribunal by an Award dated 26.7.2002, while holding that in terminating the services of the respondents the appellant has failed to comply with the statutory requirements contained in section 25 F of the Industrial Disputes Act, awarded only retrenchment compensation alongwith notice pay together with interest @ 9% per annum.",Facts

An intra court appeal preferred thereagainst has been dismissed by a Division Bench of the said Court by reason of the impugned judgment.,Facts
"Mr. Vikas Singh, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the appellant would submit that Madhya Pradesh Bhawan being merely a Circuit House of the Government of Madhya Pradesh, is not an ""Industry"" within the meaning of section 2(j) of the Industrial Disputes Act.",Argument
"Learned counsel urged that in that view of the matter, it was not a fit case where a direction of re instatement with full back wages should have been issued.",Argument
"Mr. Sujoy Ghosh, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent, on the other hand, would submit that although the question as to whether sovereign functions of the State would come within the purview of the definition of ""Industry"" is pending for consideration before the Seven Judges' Bench having been referred to by a Constitution Bench in State of U.P. v Jai Bir Singh [(2005) 5 SCC 1 2005 Indlaw SC 766], but so long the existing law is not set aside, Madhya Pradesh Bhawan wherein even the private guests are also entertained would bring the establishment within the purview of ""Industry"".",Argument

The question, however, would be as to whether in a situation of this nature, relief of reinstatement in services should have been granted.	Precedent
It is now well settled by reason of a catena of decisions of this Court that, the relief of reinstatement with full back wages would not be granted automatically only because it would be lawful to do so.	Precedent

"The sole question for consideration before this Court is whether the registration of the word ""RAMAYAN"" as a trade mark, being the name of a Holy Book of Hindus, is prohibited under Section 9(2) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999?",Ratio of the decision
Rival submissions:,Argument
"Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant was in the business of manufacturing, trading and marketing of incense sticks since 1981 and the respondent herein was a dealer of the appellant herein.",Argument
"The goods under the trade mark ""RAMAYAN"" have been advertised by him through various means including the publication of cautionary notices in newspapers.",Argument
"Learned counsel further submitted that through extensive use, wide advertisement and the excellent quality of the products, the trademark ""RAMAYAN"" and the carton in which the products are sold has become distinctive in such a manner that use of the same or similar trademark or carton by any other person will cause confusion and deception in the trade and amongst the public.",Argument
The sale was done through a network of dealers and distributors and the respondent herein was a dealer of the appellant herein.,Argument
"Learned counsel submitted that after the termination of dealership, the respondent herein started selling incense sticks under the trade mark ""RAMAYAN"" written in the same style and manner.",Argument
"Learned counsel further contended that the mere fact that the trade mark, being the name of a religious book, cannot be a sufficient ground for refusal of registration under Section 9(2) of the Act and is not based on evidence on record that the feelings of any section of the Hindus having been hurt by its use in relation to incense sticks.",Argument
She further submitted that the Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks rightly held that the impugned trade mark consists of device of crown and the word is capable of distinguishing the goods of the appellant herein and the trade mark is not included in the list of marks not registrable under the Act.,Argument
"She further claimed that it has already been proved before the Court of Assistant Registrar that the appellant was using the trade mark since 1981 and hence, is the prior user in comparison to the respondent.",Argument
"According to the learned counsel, the Board, totally misconstrued the observations of the Standing Committee in the Eighth Report on the Trade Marks Bill, 1993.",Argument
"Relying upon Clause 13.3 of the said report, it was submitted that even though the Committee had observed that ""any symbol relating to religious gods, goddesses, places of worship should not ordinarily be registered as a trade mark"", it specifically refrained from prohibiting registration of such marks.",Argument
It was further submitted that the Board has erroneously relied upon the decision of this Court in Registrar of Trade Marks vs Ashok Chandra Rakhit AIR 1955 SC 558 1955 Indlaw SC 88 by proceeding on the basis that the said case was an authority on the question that all religious names or symbols are prohibited from being registered whereas the fact of the matter is that this Court had merely upheld the concurrent findings of the Registrar and the High Court that the word 'SHREE' was incapable of distinguishing the goods of any one trader.,Argument
"The said case is also distinguishable by the fact that it was the invariable practice of the trade mark office not to register the word 'SHREE' but this is not so with the word ""RAMAYAN"".",Argument
"Relying upon a decision of this Court in Mumbai International Airport Private Limited vs Golden Chariot Airport and Another (2010) 10 SCC 422 2010 Indlaw SC 776, it is further submitted that the respondent herein had himself claimed the use of the identical mark and therefore, it did not lie in his mouth to object to the registration of the word in the name of the appellant.",Argument
She further contended that the Board ought to have seen that there are several cases which indicate that the use of the names of Hindu deities as trade mark is a common practice and no one has complained about the same being sensitive to Hindu religious sentiments for which reliance was placed on a decision of this Court in K.R. Chinna Krishna Chettiar vs Sri Ambal & Co. AIR 1970 SC 146 1969 Indlaw SC 170.,Argument
"Learned counsel also placed reliance on Corn Products Refining Co. vs Shangrila Food Products Ltd. 1960 (1) SCR 968 1959 Indlaw SC 211 in support of the submission that before the applicant can seek to derive assistance for the success of his application from the presence of a number of marks having one or more common features which occur in his mark also, he has to prove that those marks had acquired a reputation by user in the market.",Argument
"Learned counsel finally contended that the Board erred in law while setting aside the judgment of the Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks while holding adversely about its distinctiveness, the mark causing deception and not having been used in an honest manner.",Argument
"Learned senior counsel for the respondent contended that the impugned mark, being name of a religious book, cannot become the subject matter of monopoly for an individual.",Argument
"He further contended that the mark ""RAMAYAN"" is not a distinctive mark and is devoid of any distinctive character.",Argument
The mark is not capable of distinguishing the goods of one person from those of another.,Argument
"It was also contended that the mark ""RAMAYAN"" is not registrable since it is the name of a famous and well known religious book.",Argument
It was also claimed that more than 20 traders in Patna and many more are using the trade mark and thus it has become public juris.,Argument
"In support of the same, learned senior counsel placed reliance upon a decision of this Court in National Bell Co. vs Metal Goods Mfg. Co. (P) Ltd. and Another 1970 (3) SCC 665 1970 Indlaw SC 524.",Argument
"He further submitted that the impugned mark is identical with the respondent's mark ""BADSHAH RAMAYAN"" which is pending registration and the impugned registration will cause harassment to other traders and purchasing public would be bound to be confused and deceived.",Argument
Learned senior counsel finally claimed that the Board was right in setting aside the order dated 31.03.2004 passed by the Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks.,Argument

He further added that his application for the registration of the same trade mark claiming user since 05.11.1986 is pending for registration.,Ratio of the decision
"The application was further opposed with the reasoning that it carries a large sentimental value for the people and therefore, no one can claim sole right to the use of such a word.",Ratio of the decision
"It was also admitted by the respondent herein that more than 20 traders in Patna are using the trade mark ""RAMAYAN"".",Ratio of the decision
"Finally, it was submitted that the impugned mark is identical with the respondent's mark ""BADSHAH RAMAYAN"" which is pending registration and the impugned registration will cause confusion among general public.",Ratio of the decision
"Though the Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks dismissed the application filed by the respondent herein, the Board set aside the said order after holding that the trade mark ""RAMAYAN"" is not distinctive of the goods of the appellant as it is being used as a mark for the same products by more than 20 traders in Patna and in different parts of the country and has become public juris and common to the trade.",Ratio of the decision

"(a) which are devoid of any distinctive character, that is to say, not capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one person from those of another person;",Statute

"(c) which consist exclusively of marks or indications which have become customary in the current language or in the bona fide and established practices of the trade, shall not be registered:",Statute
Provided that a trade mark shall not be refused registration if before the date of application for registration it has acquired a distinctive character as a result of the use made of it or is a well known trade mark.,Statute
(2) A mark shall not be registered as a trade mark if,Statute
(a) it is of such nature as to deceive the public or cause confusion;,Statute
(b) it contains or comprises of any matter likely to hurt the religious susceptibilities of any class or section of the citizens of India;,Statute

(c) the shape which gives substantial value to the goods.,Statute
Explanation.,Statute
"For the purposes of this section, the nature of goods or services in relation to which the trade mark is used or proposed to be used shall not be a ground for refusal of registration.""",Statute
"This section stipulates that the trade marks which are devoid of any distinctive character or which consist exclusively of marks or indications which may serve in trade to designate the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, values, geographical origin or the time of production of goods or rendering of the services or other characteristics of the goods or service or which consist exclusively of marks or indications which have become customary in the current language or in the bona fide and established practice of the trade shall not be registered, unless it is shown that the mark has in fact acquired a distinctive character as a result of use before the date of application.",Ratio of the decision

"It further provides that if a mark consists exclusively of (a) the shape of goods which form the nature of goods themselves, or (b) the shape of goods which is necessary to obtain a technical result, or (c) the shape which gives substantial value of the goods then it shall not be registered as trade mark.",Ratio of the decision
"From Clause 13.3 of the Eighth Report on the Trade Marks Bill, 1993 submitted by the Parliamentary Standing Committee, we find that the Committee expressed its opinion that any symbol relating to Gods, Goddesses, places of worship should not ordinarily be registered as a trade mark.",Ratio of the decision
"However, the Committee did not want to disturb the existing trade marks by prohibiting their registration as it will result in a chaos in the market.",Ratio of the decision
"At the same time, the Committee trusted that Government will initiate appropriate action if someone complaints that a particular trade mark is hurting his religious susceptibilities.",Ratio of the decision
This report was presented on 21.04.1994.,Ratio of the decision
"When the report was presented, the appellant's trade mark had not been registered and the application filed by the respondent herein opposing its registration was dismissed only on 31.03.2004 by the Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks.",Ratio of the decision
"The word ""RAMAYAN"" represents the title of a book written by Maharishi Valmiki and is considered to be a religious book of the Hindus in our country.",Ratio of the decision
"Thus, using exclusive name of the book ""RAMAYAN"", for getting it registered as a trade mark for any commodity could not be permissible under the Act.",Ratio of the decision
"If any other word is added as suffix or prefix to the word ""RAMAYAN"" and the alphabets or design or length of the words are same as of the word ""RAMAYAN"" then the word ""RAMAYAN"" may lose its significance as a religious book and it may be considered for registration as a trade mark.",Ratio of the decision
"However, in the present case, we find that the appellant had applied for registration of the word ""RAMAYAN"" as a trade mark.",Ratio of the decision
"We also find that in the photographs, after adding ""OM's"" to the word ""RAMAYAN"", at the top and in between ""OM's and RAMAYAN"", the sentence, ""Three Top Class Aromatic Fragrance"", is also written.",Ratio of the decision
"Thus, it is not a case that the appellant is seeking the registration of the word ""OM's RAMAYAN"" as a trade mark.",Ratio of the decision
"Further, from the photographs, we find that the photographs of Lord Rama, Sita and Lakshman are also shown in the label which is a clear indication that the appellant is taking advantage of the Gods and Goddesses which is otherwise not permitted.",Ratio of the decision
"In National Bell Co. 1970 Indlaw SC 524 (supra), this Court has held that the distinctiveness of the trade mark in relation to the goods of a registered proprietor of such a trade mark may be lost in a variety of ways e.g. by the goods not being capable of being distinguished as the goods of such a proprietor or by extensive piracy so that the marks become public juris.",Precedent
The principle underlying clause (c) of Section 32 is that the property in a trade mark exists so long as it continues to be distinctive of the goods of the registered proprietor in the eyes of the public or a section of the public.,Ratio of the decision
"If the proprietor is not in a position to use the mark to distinguish his goods from those of others or has abandoned it or the mark has become so common in the market that it has ceased to connect him with his goods, there would hardly be any justification in retaining it on the register.",Ratio of the decision
"It has also come on record that the word ""RAMAYAN"" is being used as a mark for the similar products by more than 20 traders in Patna and in different parts of the country, and therefore, it has become public juris and common to the trade.",Ratio of the decision
Conclusion:,Ratio of the decision
"There are many holy and religious books like Quran, Bible, Guru Granth Sahib, Ramayan etc., to name a few.",Ratio of the decision
The answer to the question as to whether any person can claim the name of a holy or religious book as a trade mark for his goods or services marketed by him is clearly 'NO'.,Ratio of the decision
"Moreover, the appellant has not been able to establish that the word ""RAMAYAN"" for which he has applied the trade mark had acquired a reputation of user in the market inasmuch as, we find that there are more than 20 traders in the city using the word ""RAMAYAN"" as a mark for the similar products and also in different parts of the country.",Ratio of the decision
"On a perusal of the artistic work said to have been created, there is no doubt that both the marks are identical in design, colour, scheme and the reproduction of photographs is in such a manner that an ordinary buyer would reasonably come to a mistaken conclusion that the article covered by one brand can be the article covered by the other.",Ratio of the decision
Both the parties have claimed to be manufacturing units engaged in certain goods.,Ratio of the decision
"Further, the respondent herein claimed that though he had been in the business since 1980, he had developed and published the artistic work in 1986 and has also been using the mark as a trademark and claiming use since 1986 whereas the appellant herein claimed use of the trademark since 1987.",Ratio of the decision
"However, by filing an application to the concerned authority, the appellant has claimed the use since 1981.",Ratio of the decision
"Further, in various pleadings in the Title Suits filed by the respondent herein, the appellant herein has admitted the use and publication of the artistic mark of the respondent before the date of claim of the first use by the appellant, that is, 1987.",Ratio of the decision
"From these facts, it is clear that the respondent herein was using the artistic mark earlier in point of time to that of the appellant herein.",Ratio of the decision

Section 13(1) reads as follows:,Statute
"13(1) Subject to the provisions of this section and the other provisions of this Act, copyright shall subsist throughout India in the following classes of works, this is to say,	Statute
(a) original literary, dramatic, musical and artis tic works;	Statute
(b) cinematograph films; and	Statute
(c) [sound recording]	Statute
It is obvious that what is claimed by Respondent No.1 Devkatta is only copyright in the title Desi Boys"".",Ratio of the decision
"It is, therefore, not necessary to examine if a mere synopsis or a note of a story amounts to a literary work.",Ratio of the decision
"Admittedly, Devkatta has not made any film by the name ""Desi Boys"" and his only grievance is about the infringement of copyright in the title which according to him is the soul of his story and copying it takes away everything from his story.",Ratio of the decision
"The question that arises is whether copyright exists in the title ""Desi Boys"".",Ratio of the decision
A title of a work has been considered to be not fit to be the subject of copyright law as will be apparent from the cases considered later.,Ratio of the decision
"A title by itself is in the nature of a name of a work and is not complete by itself, without the work.",Ratio of the decision
No instance of a title having been held to be the subject of copyright has been pointed out to us.,Ratio of the decision
"It must be noted that in India copyright is a statutory right recognized and protected by The Copyright Act, 1957.",Ratio of the decision
"It must therefore be first seen if the title ""Desi Boys"" can be the subject of copyright.",Ratio of the decision
"On a plain reading of Section 13, copyright subsists in inter alia an original literary work.",Ratio of the decision
"In the first place a title does not qualify for being described as ""work"".",Ratio of the decision
It is incomplete in itself and refers to the work that follows.,Ratio of the decision
"Secondly, the combination of the two words ""Desi"" and ""Boys"" cannot be said to have anything original in it.",Ratio of the decision
They are extremely common place words in India.,Ratio of the decision
"It is obvious, therefore, that the title ""Desi Boys"", assuming it to be a work, has nothing original in it in the sense that its origin cannot be attributed to the respondent No.1.",Ratio of the decision
In fact these words do not even qualify for being described as 'literary work'.,Ratio of the decision
"The Oxford English Dictionary gives the meaning of the word 'literary' as ""concerning the writing, study, or content of literature, especially of the kind valued for quality of form"".",Ratio of the decision
"The mere use of common words, such as those used here, cannot qualify for being described as 'literary'.",Ratio of the decision
"In the present case, the title of a mere synopsis of a story is said to have been used for the title of a film.",Ratio of the decision
"The title in question cannot therefore be considered to be a 'literary work' and, hence, no copyright can be said to subsist in it, vide Section 13; nor can a criminal complaint for infringement be said to be tenable on such basis.",Ratio of the decision
The decisions cited on behalf of the appellants show that it is well settled that copyright does not subsist in a title of work.,Ratio of the decision
"In Hogg vs Maxwell reported in (1866 67) L.R.2 Ch. App. 307, the question was whether the defendant had infringed the copyright of the plaintiff in the title of a monthly magazine called ""Belgravia"".",Precedent
"Referring to the title ""Belgravia"" the Court observed:",Precedent
"It is quite absurd to suppose that the Legislature, in providing for the registration of that which was to be the indicium of something outside the registry, in the shape of a volume or part of a volume, meant that, by the registration of one word, copyright in that one word could be obtained, even although that one word should be registered as what was to be the title of a book or of a magazine. .	Precedent
I apprehend, indeed, that if it were necessary to decide the point, it must be held that there cannot be what is termed copyright in a single word, although the word should be used as a fitting title for a book.	Precedent
The copyright contemplated by the Act must be not in a single word, but in some words in the shape of a volume, or part of a volume, which is communicated to the public, by which the public are benefited, and in return for which a certain protection is given to the author of the work.	Precedent
All arguments, therefore, for the purpose of maintaining this bill on the ground of copyright appear to me to fall to the ground.",Precedent
"In Francis Day & Hunter Ltd. vs Twentieth Century Fox Corporation Ltd. and Ors. reported in AIR 1940 Privy Council 55 1939 Indlaw PC 11, the Privy Council considered the infringement of copyright in the title of a song by its adoption for the title of a film.",Precedent
The Privy Council observed:,Precedent
"In the present case the title was originally applied to a musical composition, whereas it has been applied by the respondents to a motion picture or a film.	Precedent
The argument of the appellant company would be the same, it seems, if the application of the title complained of had been to a picture or a statue.	Precedent
On this reasoning it would be said that the title Adam"" applied to a work of statuary would be infringed if that title were used as that of a novel.",Precedent
These and other anomalous consequences justify the broad principle that in general a title is not by itself a proper subject matter of copyright.,Precedent
"As a rule a title does not involve literary composition, and is not sufficiently substantial to justify a claim to protection.",Precedent
"That statement does not mean that in particular cases a title may not be on so extensive a scale, and of so important a character, as to be a proper subject of protection against being copied.",Precedent
"As Jessel M.R. said in Dicks vs Yates (which, as Lindley L.J. said in Licensed Victuallers' Newspaper Co. vs Bingham, virtually overruled on this point Weldon vs Dicks) there might be copyright in a title ""as, for instance, in a whole page of title or something of that kind requiring invention."" But this could not be said of the facts in the present case.",Precedent
"There may have been a certain amount, though not a high degree, of originality in thinking of the theme of the song, and even in choosing the title, though it is of the most obvious.",Precedent
"To ""break the bank"" is a hackneyed expression, and Monte Carlo is, or was, the most obvious place at which that achievement or accident might take place.",Precedent
"The theme of the film is different from that of the song, and their Lordships see no ground in copyright law to justify the appellants' claim to prevent the use by the respondents of these few obvious words, which are too unsubstantial to constitute an infringement, especially when used in so different a connection.""",Precedent
That case is apposite in the sense that the title of a song was adopted as the title of a film like in the present case the title of the synopsis of a story has been adopted as a title of a film and not another story.,Ratio of the decision
Moreover the title comprised of common words as in the present case and they were held that they were too unsubstantial to constitute an infringement.,Ratio of the decision
"In E.M. Forster and Anr. vs A.N. Parasuram reported in AIR 1964 Madras 331 1964 Indlaw MAD 29481 the author of ""A passage to India"" E.M. Forster filed a suit against the defendants for alleged infringement of copyright in the title of the book for adopting as a title the name of the defendants guide written for students, as ""E M Forster, A Passage to India, Everyman's guide"".",Precedent
"The Court reviewed the law on the subject, (i)Macmillan vs Suresh Chander Deb, ILR 17 Cat 951, (ii) Longman vs Winchester, (1809)16 Ves 269, (iii) Dicks vs Yates, (1881) 18 Ch D 79, and observed that there was no copyright in respect of title vide page 231 of the report.",Precedent
Eventually the Court held :,Precedent
"As we have earlier affirmed, there is no copyright in the title and purchasers, whether of the original work or of the guide, are most unlikely to be illiterate, or unacquainted with English.	Precedent
It will be perfectly clear to them, from the words enclosed in brakets as a sub title, that they were acquiring, not the original work, but a guide for University students. .""",Precedent
"The same question arose in Kanungo Media (P) Ltd. v RGV Film Factory & Ors. reported in (2007) ILR 1 Delhi 1122 where the Court declined injunction against the defendant for using the brand name and title ""Nishabd"" alleging similar to the film of the plaintiff therein.",Precedent
"The learned Judge A.K. Sikri, J. (as His Lordship then was) referred to decisions of the American Courts and observed that the position is the same as under the copyright law in India:",Precedent
"12. .	Precedent
What, therefore, follows is that if a junior user uses the senior user's literary title as the title of a work that by itself does not infringe the copyright of a senior user's work since there is no copyright infringement merely from the identity or similarity of the titles alone.",Precedent
The Court then considered the question of protection of title as a trademark with which we are not concerned in this case.,Ratio of the decision
"Subsequently, in R. Radha Krishnan vs Mr. A.R. Murugadoss & Ors. reported in 2013 5 L.W. 429, the Madras High Court followed the decision of the Delhi High Court in the Kanungo Media Case and rejected an injunction for restraining the defendant from using the title of the plaintiff's film 'Raja Rani'.",Ratio of the decision
The Madras High Court considered various other decisions and held that the words 'Raja Rani' are words of common parlance which denote the king or the queen and cannot be protected under the law of copyright.,Ratio of the decision
"The two judgments of the Madras High Court cited above and the judgment of the Delhi High Court in our view, lay down the correct law.",Ratio of the decision
"The learned counsel for the appellants relied on passages from Copinger and Skone James on Copyright Sixteenth Edition by Kevin Garnett, M.A, Gillian Davies, D.L., Ph.D. and Gwilym Harbottle, B.A. (Oxon) at page 70:",Ratio of the decision
"Names and titles as literary works.	Ratio of the decision
In the same vein is the reluctance of English courts to confer copyright protection on titles of newspapers, magazines, books and the like.	Ratio of the decision
In relation to books in particular, the title normally forms part of a copyright work consisting of the book as a whole and the issue here may be whether the copying of the title amounts to the taking of a substantial part of the whole work.	Ratio of the decision
General statements can nevertheless be found in non copyright cases to the effect that there is no property in a name or title standing alone unless it is the subject of goodwill or a registered trade mark.",Ratio of the decision
The learned authors observed:,Ratio of the decision
"The courts, have, however, been careful not to rule out the possibility of such protection in appropriate circumstances, although in practice no case has ever gone this far.	Ratio of the decision
The only concrete example which has been given judicially is the now archaic practice of the title page of a book consisting of an extended passage of text.",Ratio of the decision
In relation to copyright in characters and titles the learned authors observed:,Ratio of the decision
"It is very difficult to protect titles of films by an action for infringement of copyright due to the requirements of originality and that a substantial part of a work be copied.	Ratio of the decision
If a well known title of a film is used without authority, the owner's remedy is likely to lie in passing off.	Ratio of the decision
Protection by registration as a trade mark may be available provided the title in sufficiently distinctive.",Ratio of the decision
"We are thus, of the view, that no copyright subsists in the title of a literary work and a plaintiff or a complainant is not entitled to relief on such basis except in an action for passing off or in respect of a registered trademark comprising such titles.",Ratio of the decision
"This does not mean that in no case can a title be a proper subject of protection against being copied as held in Dicks v Yates where Jessel M.R said ""there might be copyright in a title as for instance a whole page of title or something of that kind requiring invention"" or as observed by Copinger (supra).",Ratio of the decision
"In the present case we find that there is no copyright in the title ""Desi Boys"" and thus no question of its infringement arises.",Ratio of the decision
The prosecution based on allegations of infringement of copyright in such a title is untenable.,Ratio of the decision
The learned counsel for the respondents indeed contended that the applications under Section 482 were rightly dismissed since these facts alleged by the appellants depend on evidence at the trial.,Argument
"It is not possible to agree since it has throughout been the case of the respondent no. 1 Devkatta that he is claiming copyright only in the title of the synopsis of his story ""Desi Boys"" and he has not even seen the film of the appellants nor does he know the story.",Ratio of the decision
The learned counsel for the respondent was however right in his submissions that it is not necessary to furnish all the ingredients of the complaint and failing which the complaint is liable to be dismissed on that ground.,Ratio of the decision
It is not necessary to consider the decisions cited by the respondents on this point.,Ratio of the decision
"In the result, both the Criminal Appeals are allowed.",Ruling by Present Court
"The Criminal Case no. SW/332 of 2011 pending before the Learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Mumbai is hereby quashed.",Ruling by Present Court
Appeals allowed,Ruling by Present Court
