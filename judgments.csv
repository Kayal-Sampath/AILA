6,"The principal point of law which arises in this appeal by special leave is whether respondent number 2, the State of Punjab, exercising its appellate jurisdiction under Rule 6(6) of the Punjab Welfare Officers Recruitment and Conditions of Service Rules, 1952 (hereinafter called 'the Rules') is a Tribunal within the meaning of article 136(1) of the Constitution.",Argument,1
7,"The appellant, the Associated Cement Companies limited , Bhupendra Cement Works, Surajpur, challenges the validity of the appellate order passed by respondent number 2 on July 4, 1962 under the provision of the said Rule, directing the appellant to reinstate its Welfare Officer, P.  N.  Sharma-respondent number    1.",Argument,0
8,"At the hearing of this appeal, a preliminary objection has been raised by Mr.  Goyal on behalf of respondent number 1 that special leave should not have been granted to the appellant, because the appeal is incompetent inasmuch as respondent number 2 against whose appellate decision the appellant purports to have preferred the present appeal is not a tribunal under article 136(1).",Argument,1
9,"If the preliminary objection fails, then it would become necessary to consider the appellant's contention that the impugned appellate order is invalid and erroneous and must be set aside.",Ratio of the decision,0

12,"Under the provisions of the Factories Act, 1948 (number 63 of 1948) (hereinafter called the Act) read with the provisions of the Rules, the appellant was required to appoint one Welfare Officer and to notify his appointment and 369 qualification to the Chief Inspector of Factories.",Ratio of the decision,1
13,Respondent number 1 was appointed such a Welfare Officer.,Ratio of the decision,1
14,"The letter of appointment issued to him on March 2, 1956, stated that he would be liable to be transferred from one unit of the appellant to another and that his services could be terminated by the appellant by one month's notice or with one month's pay in lieu thereof.",Ruling by Present Court,1
15,"Respondent number 1 was first posted at Lakheri Cement Works, Lakheri in Rajasthan, where he joined duty on March 14, 1956.",Ruling by Present Court,0
16,"Thereafter, he was transferred from one place to another according to the requirements of service and the working of the appellant's factories.",Ruling by Present Court,0

18,"He was working at these Works until September 26, 1961, when his services were terminated.",Ruling by Present Court,0
19,"It appears that the appellant transferred respondent number 1 from Bhupendra Cement Works to Kymore Works which is near Katni in Madhya Pradesh, but apparently, respondent number 1 was not prepared to go to Kymore Works, and after long and protracted correspondence between the parties, the appellant wrote to him on September 26, 1961, that since he had not proceeded to Kymore on transfer as directed, he had ceased to be in the employment of the appellant, and his name had been struck off from the Company's roll.",Ruling by Present Court,0
20,Respondent number 1 then filed an appeal before respondent number   2 as the appellate authority under R.  6(6) of the Rules.,Ruling by Present Court,1

26,"Before proceeding to deal with the preliminary objection, we may conveniently refer to the relevant provisions of the Act and the Rules.",Ruling by Present Court,0
27,The Act has been passed in 1948 with the object of consolidating and amending the law regulating labour in factories.,Argument,0

29,Section 49 deals with the appointment of Welfare Officers.,Ratio of the decision,0
30,"S. 49(1) provides that in every ,factory wherein five hundred or more workers are ordinarily employed, the occupier shall employ in the factory such number of welfare officers as may be prescribed.",Ratio of the decision,0
31,"It is common ground that the appellant falls within the, scope of section 49(1), and so, it has been appointing welfare officers in its factories; in fact, respondent number 1 was one of such Welfare Officers appointed by the appellant.",Ruling by Present Court,1
32,"Section 49(2) provides that the State Government may prescribe the duties, qualifications and conditions of service of officers employed under sub-section (1).",Ruling by Present Court,0
33,It is by virtue of the powers conferred on the State Government that respondent number 2 has framed the Rules.,Ruling by Present Court,0
34,"The Rules were framed by respondent number 2 in 1952 and have ,been published in the Punjab Government Gazette on March 26, 1952, and they came into force from September 30, 1952.",Ruling by Present Court,0

39,"In the present appeal, we are ,concerned with R. 6.",Ratio of the decision,0
40,"Rule 6 reads thus ""(1) A Welfare Officer shall be given appropriate status corresponding to the status of the other executive heads of the factory.",Ruling by Present Court,0

48,(7) The State Government may pass such interim order as may be necessary pending the decision of appeal filed under sub-rule (5) or sub-rule (6).,Ruling by Present Court,0
49,"It would be noticed that it is under rule 6(6) that the impugned order has been passed by respondent number 2, and the question which has first to be considered in dealing with the present appeal is whether respondent number 2 can be said to be a tribunal within the meaning of article 136(1) so as to justify the appellant to bring the appellate decision of respondent number 2 before this Court by special leave under the said Article.",Ruling by Present Court,0
50,"article 136(1) reads thus : "" Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter, the Supreme Court may, in its discretion, grant special leave 372 . lm15 to appeal from any judgment, decree, determination, sentence or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of India. """,Ruling by Present Court,0
51,"Mr.  Goyal contends that respondent number 2, is not a tribunal under article 1 3 6(1) and so, the impugned appellate order passed by it cannot be challenged by appeal under the said article.",Ruling by Present Court,0
52,It would be noticed that article136(1) refers to a tribunal as distinguished from a court.,Ruling by Present Court,0
53,"The expression ""court"" in the context denotes a tribunal . constituted by the State as a part of the ordinary hierarchy of ,courts which are invested with the State's inherent judicial powers.",Ruling by Present Court,0
54,"A sovereign State discharges legislative, executive and judicial functions and can legitimately claim corresponding powers which are described as legislative, executive and judicial powers.",Ratio of the decision,0
55,"Under our Constitution, the judicial functions and powers of the State are primarily conferred on the ordinary courts which have been constituted under its relevant provisions.",Ruling by Present Court,0
56,"The Constitution recognised a hierarchy of courts and to their adjudication are normally . ,entrusted all disputes between citizens and citizens as well as between the citizens and the State.",Ruling by Present Court,0
57,These courts can be described as ordinary courts of civil judicature.,Ruling by Present Court,0
58,They are governed by their prescribed rules of procedure and they deal with questions of fact and law raised before them by adopting a process which is described as judicial process.,Ruling by Present Court,0
59,"The powers which these courts exercise, are judicial powers, the functions they discharge are judicial functions and the decisions they reach and pronounce are judicial decisions.",Ruling by Present Court,1
60,In every State there are administrative bodies or authorities which are required to deal with matters within their jurisdiction in an administrative manner and their decisions are described as administrative decisions.,Ruling by Present Court,0
61,"In reaching their administrative decisions, administrative bodies can and often to take into consideration ,questions of policy.",Ruling by Present Court,0
62,"It is not unlikely that even in this process of reaching administrative decisions, the administrative bodies or authorities are required to act fairly and objectively and would in many cases have to follow the principles of natural justice; but the authority to reach decisions conferred on such administrative bodies is clearly distinct and separate from the judicial power conferred on courts, and the decisions pronounced by administrative bodies are similarly distinct and separate in character from judicial decisions pronounced by courts.",Ruling by Present Court,0
63,Tribunals which fall within the purview of article136(1) occupy a special of their own under the scheme of our Consti 373 tution.,Ruling by Present Court,0
64,"Special matters and questions are entrusted to them for their decision and in that sense, they share with the courts one common characteristic: both the courts and the tribunals are "" constituted by the State and are invested with judicial as distinguished from purely administrative or executive functions.

66,They are both adjudicating bodies and they deal with and finally determine disputes between parties which are entrusted to their jurisdiction.,Ruling by Present Court,0
67,"The procedure followed by the courts is regularly prescribed and in discharging their functions and exercising their powers, the courts have to conform to that procedure.",Ruling by Present Court,0
68,"The procedure which the tribunals have to follow may not always be so strictly prescribed, but the approach adopted by both the courts and the tribunals is substantially the same, and there is no essential difference between the functions that they discharge.",Ruling by Present Court,0
69,"As in the case of courts, so in the case of tribunals, it is the State's inherent judicial power which has been transferred and by virtue of the said power, it is the State's inherent judicial function which they discharge.",Ruling by Present Court,1
70,"Judicial functions and judicial powers are one of the essential attributes of a sovereign State, and on considerations of policy, the State transfers its judicial functions and powers mainly to the courts established by the Constitution; -but that does not affect the competence of the State, by appropriate measures, to transfer a part of its judicial powers and functions to tribunals by entrusting to them the task of adjudicating upon special matters and disputes between parties.",Ruling by Present Court,1
71,"It is really not possible or even expedient to attempt to describe exhaustively the features which are common to the tribunals and the courts, and features which are distinct and separate.",Ruling by Present Court,0
72,The basic and the fundamental feature which is common to both the courts and the tribunals is that they discharge judicial functions and exercise judicial powers which inherently vest in a sovereign State.,Ruling by Present Court,0
73,This problem has been considered by this Court on several occasions and judicial decisions show that it arises in two different forms.,Ruling by Present Court,0
74,"Sometimes, the question which is posed for the decision of this Court is whether a particular decision reached by an authority or a body can be corrected by the issue of a writ of certiorari by the High Courts in exercise of their jurisdiction under article226; and in dealing with this question, it becomes necessary to enquire whether the impugned decision is a judicial or quasi-judicial decision and whether in reaching it, the authority concerned was re quired to adopt a judicial approach and follow the principles of (1) [1955] 1 supreme court reporter 267 at P.  272. 34 natural justice.",Ruling by Present Court,0
75,We will very briefly indicate how this question has been considered by this Court by referring to some important decisions in that behalf.,Ruling by Present Court,0
76,"In the Province of Bombay vs Kusaldas S.  Advani and Others,(1) this Court had to consider whether the powers given to the Provincial Government under sections 10 and 12 of the Bombay Land Requisition Ordinance (V of 1947) required that in exercising them, the Government had to act judicially in the matter of making an order of requisition under section 3.",Ruling by Present Court,0
77,"According to the majority decision, the relevant powers and the scheme of the Ordinance did not make it incumbent on the State Government to act judicially in exercising its powers under section 3.",Ruling by Present Court,0
78,"Dealing with this question, Das J. , as he then was, deduced two principles from an elaborate examination of the relevant decisions cited before the Court.",Ruling by Present Court,0
79,"He held that if a statute empowers in authority not being a court in the ordinary sense to decide disputes arising out of a claim made by one party under the statute which claim is opposed by another party and to determine the respective rights of the contesting parties who are opposed to each other, there is a lis and prima facie, and in the absence of anything in the statute to the contrary, it is the duty of the authority to act judicially and the decision of the authority is a quasi-judicial act.",Ruling by Present Court,0
80,"The second principle which he deduced was that if a statutory body has power to do any act which will prejudicially affect the subject, then although there are not two parties apart from the authority, and the contest is between the authority proposing to do the act and the subject opposing it, the final determination of the authority will yet be a quasi-judicial act provided the authority is required by the statute to act judicially (page 725).",Ruling by Present Court,0
81,"Kania, C.  J. , on the other hand, observed that the true position was that ""when the law under which the authority is making a decision itself requires a judicial approach, the decision would be a quasi-judicial decision.",Ruling by Present Court,0
82,"Prescribed forms are not necessary to make an inquiry judicial, provided in coming to the decision, well recognised principles of approach are required to be followed. """,Ruling by Present Court,0
83,(page 633).,Ruling by Present Court,0
84,"Before we proceed to the next decision of this Court bearing on this point, we would like to refer to the recent decision of the House of Lords in Ridge vs Baldwin and Others ( 2 ) .",Ruling by Present Court,0
85,"In that case, the House of Lords had to consider the question as to whether the watch committee in exercising its authority under section 191 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, was required to act judicially or not.",Ratio of the decision,0
86,The case itself arose out of the dismissal of the appellant Ridge who had been appointed chief constable of a borough police (1) [1950] INSC 22; [1950] supreme court reporter 621. (2) [1963] UKHL 2; L. R.  [1964] A. C.  40. 375 force in 1956.,Ratio of the decision,0
87,"On October 28, 1957, he was suspended from duty by the borough watch committee.",Ruling by Present Court,0
88,"On February 28, 1958, he was acquitted by the jury on the criminal charges against him.",Ruling by Present Court,0
89,"On March 6, 1958, on a charge alleging corruption against the appellant Donovan, J.  who tried the case, referred to the boroughs police force and remarked on its need for a leader ""who will be a new influence and who will set a different example from that which has lately obtained. """,Ruling by Present Court,0
90,"After his acquittal, the appellant applied to be reinstated, but on March 7, 1958, the watch committee at a meeting decided that he had been negligent in the discharge of his duties as chief constable, and, in purported exercise of the powers conferred on them by section 191(4) of the Act of 1882, dismissed him from that office.",Ruling by Present Court,0
91,"Before doing so, no specific charge had been formulated against him, but the watch committee acted.",Ruling by Present Court,0
92,"inter alia, on the appellant's own statements in evidence and the observations made by Donovan J.  during the course of the trial.",Ruling by Present Court,0
93,"The appellant appealed to the Home Secretary, but his appeal was dismissed on the ground that there was sufficient material on which the watch committee could properly exercise their power of dismissal under section 191(4).",Ruling by Present Court,0
94,"It is this dismissal which led to the action by the appellant against the watch committee for a declaration that his dismissal was illegal, ultra vires and void, and payment of salary from March 7, 1958, or, alternatively, payment of pension from that date and damages.",Ruling by Present Court,0
95,That is how the question which arose for decision was whether the watch committee acting under section 191(4) had to act judicially.,Ratio of the decision,0
96,"The majority decision was that it had to act judicially, and since the order of dismissal was passed without furnishing the appellant with a specific charge, it was a nullity.",Ratio of the decision,0
97,"In dealing with the appellant's contention that the watch committee had to act judicially, Lord Reid has exhaustively considered the judicial decisions bearing on this point.",Ratio of the decision,0
98,"He referred in particular to the following observation made by Atkin L.  J.  in Rex vs Electricity Commissioners, Exparte London Electricity, Joint Committee company (1920) limited & Others(-') : ""Wherever any body of persons having legal authority to determine questions affecting the rights of subjects, and having the duty to act judicially, act in excess of their legal authority, they are subject to the controlling jurisdiction of the King's Bench Division exercised in these writs.

99,"This observation was later read by Lord Hewart, C. J.  in Rex vs Legislative Committee of the Church Assembly, Exparte Havnes Smith(2), as meaning that before the decision of any authority could be sub (1) [1924] 1 K. B. D.  171, 205. 3Sup.",Ruling by Present Court,0
100,"/65-8 (2) [1928] 1 K. B. D.  411. 376 jected to the writ jurisdiction, it must appear that the said body should have legal authority to determine questions affecting the rights of subjects and should further be required to act judicially.",Ruling by Present Court,0
101,"The duty to act judicially, observed Lord Hewart, C.  J. , is an ingredient which, if the test is to be satisfied, must be present.",Ruling by Present Court,0
102,"The Privy Council in Nakkuda Ali vs Jayaratne(1), had taken the same view.",Ruling by Present Court,0
103,"Dealing with the order passed by the Controller of Textiles in Ceylon under a Defence Regulation which empowered him to cancel a licence ""where the controller has reasonable grounds to believe that any dealer is unfit to be allowed to continue as a dealer. """,Ruling by Present Court,0
104,the Privy Council held that it did not follow from the words of the relevant Defence Regulation that the controller must be acting judicially in exercising the power.,Ruling by Present Court,0
105,"It is a long step, said the Privy Council, in the argument to say that because a man is enjoined that he must not take action unless he has reasonable ground for believing something he can only arrive ,at that belief by a course of conduct analogous to the judicial process.",Ruling by Present Court,0
106,"And yet, unless that proposition is valid, there is really no ground for holding that the controller is acting judicially or quasijudicially when he acts under this regulation.",Ruling by Present Court,0
107,"If he is not under a duty so to act, then it would not be according to law that his decision should be amenable to review and, if necessary, to avoidance by the procedure of certiorari.",Ruling by Present Court,0
108,"Having set out these decisions, Lord Reid expressed his dis sent from the gloss which has been put by Lord Hewart C.  J.   in Rex vs Legislative Committee of the Church Assembly 2 ) on the observations of Atkin, L.  J.  in Rex vs Electricity Commissioners(""), and the view taken by the Privy Council in Nakkuda Ali(1); and he held that ""the power of dismissal conferred on the watch committee by section 191(4) could not have been exercised and cannot now be exercised until the watch committee have informed the constable of the grounds on which they propose to proceed and have given him a proper opportunity to present his case in defence. """,Ruling by Present Court,0
109,(page 79).,Argument,0
110,"In other words, according to Lord Reid's judgment, the necessity to follow judicial procedure and observe the principles of natural justice, flows from the nature of the decision which the watch committee had been authorised to reach under section 191(4).",Argument,0
111,"It would thus be seen that the area where the principles of natural justice have to be followed and judicial approach has to be adopted, has become wider and consequently, (2) (1928] 1 K. B. D.  411 (1) [1951] A. C.  66, 77. (3) [1924] 1 K.  B. D.  411. 377 the horizon of the writ jurisdiction has been extended in a corresponding measure.",Argument,0
112,"In dealing with questions as to whether any impugned orders could be revised under article 226 of our Constitution, the test prescribed by Lord Reid in this judgment may afford considerable assistance.",Argument,0
113,"In Nagendra Nath Bora & Another vs The Commissioner of Hills Division and Appeals, Assam, & others (1) this Court had to consider whether the jurisdiction of the High Court under article 226 and 227 of the Constitution could be invoked against the decision of the appellate authority constituted under the Eastern Bengal and Assam Excise Act, 1910 (E.  B. & Assam Act 1 of 1910).",Argument,0
114,"The scheme of the Act was examined and it was noticed that the Act had laid down a regular hierarchy of authorities, one above the other, with the right of hearing appeals or revisions.",Argument,0
115,"It is true that there was no provision in the Act which required, in express terms, that reasoned orders should be recorded; but in the context of the subject-matter of the rules, it was held that it was the duty of the appellate authority to hear judicially, that is to say, in an objective manner, impartially and after giving reasonable opportunity to the parties concerned in the dispute, to place their respective cases before it. (page 1254).",Argument,0
116,"On that view of the matter, the decision of the appellate authority was theoretically held to be subject to the jurisdiction of the High Court under article 226 to issue a writ of certiorari.",Argument,0
117,"In Shivji Nathubhai vs The Union of India & Others(2), this Court held that in exercising its power of review under rule 54 of the Mineral Concessions Rules, 1949, the Central Government acted judicially and not administratively.",Argument,0
118,"In consequence, the decision of the Central Government was liable to be questioned on proper grounds under article 226 of the Constitution.",Argument,0
119,"The question as to whether the State Government in granting the mining lease acted merely administratively or not, was not considered in this case, because it was enough for the purpose of deciding the appeal that the powers of review were not administrative powers and exercise of the said powers would be subject to examination by the High Courts under article 226.",Argument,0
120,"It will be noticed that in these cases, this Court was not called upon to consider whether the authorities whose decisions were challenged under article 226 were tribunals or not, because the requirement that the impugned decision should be that of a tribunal which has been prescribed by AA. 136(1) is not to be found (1) [1958] INSC 6; [1958] supreme court reporter 1240. (2) [1960] INSC 7; [1960] 2 supreme court reporter 775. 378 in article 226; and so, the only point which fell for decision was whether the impugned orders amounted to judicial or quasi-judicial decisions liable to be corrected by the issue of a writ of certiorari under article 226, or not.",Argument,0
121,That problem is different from the one which we have to decide in the present case.,Argument,0
122,Let us now refer to some of the decisions which deal with the problem with which we are concerned.,Argument,0
123,"The first decision where this question was elaborately considered was pronounced in the case of The Bharat Bank limited , Delhi, vs   Employees of the Bharat Bank limited , and the Bharat Bank Employees' Union, Delhi(1).",Argument,0
124,"In that case, an award pronounced by an Industrial Tribunal under the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, was brought to this Court in appeal by special leave under article 136(1), and the respondents' preliminary objection that the appeal was in competent, raised the problem as to whether the Industrial Tribunal was a tribunal under article 136(1) or not.",Argument,1
125,The majority decision was in favour of the view that the Industrial Tribunal is a tribunal within the meaning of -article 136(1).,Argument,0
126,"Mahajan J. , who delivered the principal judgment in support of the majority view on this point, held that ""industrial tribunals though they are not full-fledged Courts, yet exercise quasi-judicial functions and are within the ambit of the word 'tribunal' in article 136 of the Con stitution. """,Argument,0
127,(page 476).,Argument,0
128,"""The condition precedent,"" said Mahajan J. , ""for bringing a tribunal within the ambit of article 136 is that it should be constituted by the State.",Argument,0
129,"Again, a tribunal would be outside the ambit of article 136 if it is not invested with any part of the judicial functions of the State but discharges purely administrative or executive duties (page 478). """,Argument,0
130,"It is in this connection that the learned Judge added that tribunals, however, which are found invested with certain functions of a court of justice and have some of its trappings also would fall within the ambit of article 136, because, according to the learned Judge, the intention of the Constitution by the use of the word ""tribunal"" in the article seems to have been to include within the scope of article 136 tribunals adomed with similar trappings as Court but strictly not coming within that definition (page 474).",Argument,0
131,"The fact that awards pronounced by Industrial Tribunals become enforceable under section 17A subject to the conditions therein prescribed, did not make any difference to the legal position that the Industrial Tribunals were tribunals within the meaning of article 136(1).",Argument,0
132,"The majority decision in the case of the Bharat Bank(1), to which we have just referred was adopted unanimously by this Court (1) [19501 supreme court reporter 459. 379 in the case of Durga Skankar Mehta(1).",Argument,0

136,"In considering this question, the scheme of the relevant provisions of the Act was examined, the earlier decisions bearing on the point were taken into account and it was held that section 1 1 1(3) required that the Central Government, while acting as an appellate authority, had to act judicially and was entrusted with the judicial powers of the State to adjudicate upon rights of the parties in civil matters when there is a lis between the contesting parties, and so, the conclusion was inevitable that it acts as a tribunal and not as an executive body.",Argument,0
137,"In that connection, Shah J. , who spoke for the majority of the Court, observed that the proceedings before the Central Government have all the trappings of a judicial tribunal;  and by way of illustration, he referred to the fact that pleadings had to be filed, evidence had to be led, and the disputes had to be decided according to law after considering the representations made by the parties.",Argument,0

202,"If such a consideration was relevant and material, then it would no doubt, be inappropriate to say that certain authorities or bodies which are given the power to deal with disputes between parties and finally determine them, are tribunals because the judicial power of the State has been statutorily transferred to them.",Ruling by Present Court,0
203,"In that case, the more appropriate expression to use would be that the powers which they exer cise are quasi-judicial in character, and tribunals appointed under such a scheme of rigid separation of powers cannot be held to discharge the same judicial function as the courts.",Ruling by Present Court,0

208,"Reading the second proviso to R.  6(3) and R.  6(4) together, it appears that if the management wants to impose any punishment other than censure, it is required to secure the previous concurrence of the Labour Commissioner;  and when an application is made to the Labour Commissioner for obtaining his concurrence, he has to give the Welfare Officer an opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken against him and if necessary, he has to hear the parties in person.",Ruling by Present Court,0

212,"Rule 6(5) deals with a case where the Labour Commissioner refuses to give his concurrence, and in that case, it confers on the management the right to make an appeal to the State Government within the time prescribed by it.",Ruling by Present Court,0
213,It provides that the appellate decision of the State Government would be final and binding.,Ruling by Present Court,1
214,"Similarly, R.  6(6) enables the Welfare Officer upon whom the punishment mentioned in clause   (v) of sub-rule 3 is imposed without obtaining the concurrence of the Labour Commissioner to appeal to the State Government, and it provides that the appellate decision of the State Government in such a case would also be final and binding.",Ruling by Present Court,0
215,"The question which we have to decide in the present appeal is whether the State Government is a tribunal when it exercises its authority under R.  6(5) or R.  6(6), No rules have been made prescribing the procedure which the State Government should follow in dealing with appeals under these two sub-rules, and there is no statutory provision conferring on the State Government any specific powers which are usually associated with the trial in courts and which are intended to help the court in reaching its decisions.",Ruling by Present Court,0
216,"The requirements of procedure which is followed in courts and the possession of subsidiary powers which are given to courts to try the cases before them, are described as trappings of the courts, and so, it may be conceded that these trappings are not shown to exist in the case of the State Government which hears appeals under R.  6(5) and R.   6(6).",Ruling by Present Court,0
217,"But as we already stated, the consideration about the presence of all or some of the trappings of a court is really not decisive.",Ruling by Present Court,1

226,"In this connection, we may usefully recall the observation made by Lord Haldane in Local Government Board vs   Arlidge(1).",Argument,0
227,"Said Lord Haldane ""My Lords, when the duty of deciding an appeal is imposed, those whose duty it is to decide it must act judicially.",Argument,0

230,"But it does not follow that the procedure of every such tribunal must be the same. """,Argument,0
231,"Having regard to the nature of the power conferred on the State Government, it seems to us clear that for reaching a fair and objective decision in the dispute brought before it in its appellate jurisdiction, the State Government has the power to devise its own procedure and to exercise such other incidental and subsidiary powers as may be necessary to deal effectively with the dispute.",Argument,1
232,"We are, therefore, satisfied that the State Government which exercises its appellate jurisdiction under R.  6(5) and R.  6(6) of the Rules is a Tribunal within the meaning of article 136(1); and so, the present appeal brought before this Court against the impugned appellate order passed by respondent number 2, is competent.",Argument,0
233,"In the result, the preliminary objection raised by Mr.  Goyal fails and must be rejected.",Argument,0
234,That takes us to the merits of the impugned appellate order.,Argument,0
235,Mr.  Setalvad for the appellant contends that the impugned order is bad for two reasons.,Argument,0
236,"He argues that the relevant Rule which requires the concurrence of the Labour Commissioner before the management can dismiss or terminate the services of a Welfare Officer, is invalid inasmuch as it is outside the scope of the authority conferred on the State Government by section 49(2) of the Act.",Argument,1
237,"He also argues that the impugned order is invalid for the reason that in the circumstances of this case, the appeal preferred by res (1) [1915] A. C.  120, 132. 388 pondent number 1 before respondent number 2 was incompetent under rule 6(6).",Argument,0
238,Let us first examine the contention about the invalidity of the Rule itself.,Argument,0
239,"We have noticed that S.  49(2) of the Act confers on the State Government authority to prescribe the duties, qualifications and conditions of service of officers employed under subsection (1); so that there can be no doubt that the State Government would be competent to make Rules which prescribe the conditions of service of Welfare Officers.",Argument,0
240,The question is whether R.  6 which purports to prescribe such conditions of service is ultra vires S.  49(2) of the Act inasmuch as it imposes on the management the obligation to secure the concurrence of the Labour Com missioner before inflicting on the Welfare Officer the punishments to which the second proviso to R.  6(3) refers.,Argument,0
241,"In our opinion, the words ""conditions of service"" used in section   49(2) are wide enough to cover the proviso in question and sub-rules (4), (5) and (6) of Rule 6.",Argument,1
242,"Under what circumstances an employee's services can be terminated and subject to what conditions, can well be the subjectmatter of a contract of employment, because conditions of service would take in the termination of services and incidentally, the conditions subject to which such termination could be brought about.",Argument,1
243,"If that be so, we see no reason why a statutory rule imposing the obligation on the management as prescribed by the second proviso in question should be said to fall outside S.  49(2) of the Act.",Argument,1
244,"The object of conferring on the State Government the power to frame Rules in that behalf obviously is to afford special protection to Welfare Officers appointed under section 49(1), and if respondent number 2 thought that the best way to assure security of tenure to ,such officers was to require that they should not be dismissed or otherwise punished without obtaining the consent of the Labour Commissioner as required by the second proviso to R.  6(3), it would be difficult to hold that a Rule made by respondent number 2 in that behalf is not justified by the power conferred on it by section 49(2).",Argument,0
245,"Therefore, we are not impressed by Mr.  Setalvad's argument that the Rule in question is ultra vires or invalid.",Argument,0
246,"Mr.  Setalvad, however, is right in contending that the appeal preferred by respondent number 1 before respondent number 2 was incompetent.",Argument,0
247,"Rule 6(6) no doubt enables a Welfare Officer to make an appeal to the State Government if punishment has been imposed upon him contrary to the requirements of the proviso to R.  6(3), without obtaining the concurrence of the Labour Commissioner.",Argument,0
248,"The scheme of the relevant Rules appears to be that if the manage 389 ment applies for concurrence, and the concurrence is not given by the Labour Commissioner, the management can appeal under rule 6(5).",Argument,1
249,"If the concurrence is given, or if a welfare officer is dismissed without applying for concurrence, he may make an appeal under rule 6(6); but before such an appeal can be competent, it must appear that the punishment mentioned in clause (v) of subrule 3 of R.  6 has been imposed, upon him.",Argument,1
250,"In the present case, it is difficult to hold that any such punishment has been imposed upon respondent number 1.",Argument,0
251,All that the appellant has done in the present case is to terminate the services of respondent number   1 by virtue of clause 4 of his terms of appointment.,Argument,0
252,"When respondent number 1 was appointed a Welfare Officer by the appellant, the terms of his employment were communicated to him by a letter dated March 2, 1956.",Argument,0
253,"Clause 4 of this communication expressly provided that during the period of probation, the appellant could terminate respondent number 1's services without notice, and after confirmation, with one month's notice or one month's salary in lieu of notice.",Argument,1
254,"The order terminating his services specifically refers to an earlier letter addressed to him on September 23, 1961.",Argument,0
255,"In this letter, the appellant expressly informed respondent number   1 that if he did not proceed to Kymore Cement Works within the time allowed to him, his services would stand terminated from September 26, 1961, and he would be paid his salary up to the 25th September, 1961, as well as one month's salary in lieu of notice and other dues as per Company's rules.",Argument,0
256,It is thus clear that in terminating the services of respondent number 1 the appellant was merely exercising its right to put an end to respondent number 1's services with one month's salary in lieu of notice; and such an order cannot be said to amount to any punishment at all; it is an order of discharge served by the employer on his employee strictly within the terms of the employee's conditions of service.,Argument,0
257,"There is no doubt that when rule 6(3) (v) refers to dismissal or termination of service in any other manner, it takes in dismissal or termination of service which is in the nature of a punitive termination of service.",Argument,1
258,"rule 6(3) makes it clear that clauses (i) to (v) refer to punishments which could be imposed on Welfare Officers by the management; and so, before rule 6 (3) (v) can be invoked by respondent number 1, it must be shown that the termination of his services was in the nature of a punishment.",Argument,0
259,"The termination of respondent number 1's services in terms of clause 4 of his conditions of service is no more than a discharge, and as such is not a punishment; and so, it is outside rule 6(3) altogether.",Argument,1

262,"Goyal no doubt attempted to argue that though in form the order terminating respondent number 1's services purported to be an order of discharge under clause 4 of his conditions of service, in substance it is an order of dismissal; and in support of this argument, he referred us to the fact that before the impugned order was passed, considerable correspondence passed between the parties, and it appears that the appellant had transferred respondent number 1 to Kymore, and respondent number 1 apparently did not obey the said order of transfer.",Argument,0
263,"We have not thought it necessary to refer to this correspondence, because, in our opinion, it is not possible to entertain Mr.  Goyal's contention that the order of discharge in the present case in substance amounts to an order of dismissal.",Argument,0
264,It is true that the form in which the impugned order has been passed will not necessarily determine the character of the termination of respondent number   1's services.,Argument,1
265,"If respondent number 1 had proved that the impugned order amounts to his punishment, that no doubt would have been a legitimate plea on which the competence of the appeal to respondent number 2 could have been sustained;  but beyond making a vague allegation that the impugned order had been passed not bona fide, but for ulterior purpose, no attempt has been made to suggest, much less to prove, that the appellant was actuated by any improper motive in terminating his services.",Argument,0
266,"It does appear that when the appellant found that respondent number 1 was not willing to go to Kymore Cement Works where he had been transferred, it deliberately chose not to punish him, but to pass a simple order of discharge.",Argument,0
267,"In such cases, it is no doubt open to the Court to consider the substance of the matter and not to treat the form in which the order terminating the services of an employee has been passed, conclusive.",Argument,0
268,"But cases may occur in which it would be safe to conclude that the order of discharge is a bona fide order of discharge and that the employer passed such an order, because it was not its intention to cast any slur on its employee, even though it thought it necessary to terminate his services.",Argument,0

279,I think that the context of article  136 supplies the proper meaning of this word.,Argument,0
280,Article 136 concerns the regulation of the judicial power of the State vested in the Courts and other authorities.,Argument,1
281,The great purpose of article 136 is the recognition of the basic principle that one Court having supreme judicial power in the Republic will have appellate power over all Courts and adjudicating authorities vested with the judicial powers of the State throughout the territory of India barring those constituted by or under any law relating to the Armed Forces.,Argument,0
282,"In this background, the basic test of a tribunal within the meaning of article 136 is that it is an adjudicating authority (other than a Court) vested with the judicial powers of the State.",Argument,1
