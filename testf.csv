"This appeal is preferred against the judgment dated 19.8.2011 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in Criminal Appeal No.181 SB of 2000, whereby the High Court partly allowed the appeal filed by the appellants thereby confirming the conviction of the appellants with certain modifications"
"Briefly stated, case of the prosecution is that on the fateful day i.e. 18.11.1994, at about 8.00 A.M. in the morning the complainant Jagdish (PW-5) along with his two sons namely Sukhbir and Mange Ram (PW-6) were busy in cutting pullas (reeds) from the dola of their field"
"At that time, Jage Ram (A-1) and his sons Rajbir Singh"
"Raju (A-2), Rakesh (A-3) and Madan (A-4) armed with jaily, pharsi and lathis respectively, entered the land where the complainant was working with his sons and asked them not to cut the pullas as it was jointly held by both the parties"
Wordy altercations ensued between the parties and Jage Ram insisted that he would take away the entire pullas
"In the fight, the accused persons started inflicting injuries to the complainant, and his sons Rajbir"
"Raju (A-2) gave a pharsi blow on the head of Sukhbir, Jage Ram (A-1) caused injury to Jagdish (PW-5) with two jaily blows"
"Additionally, Madan and Rakesh attacked the complainant with lathi blows on shoulder and left elbow respectively and caused several other injuries to the complainant party"
"Jagdish and his injured sons raised alarm, hearing which Rajesh and Usha came to rescue them and on seeing them, the accused persons fled away"
"The injured witnesses were taken to the Primary Health Centre, Taoru where Dr. Pardeep Kumar, Medical Officer, medically examined the injured persons"
"Injured Sukhbir was vomiting in the hospital and later on he was referred to General Hospital, Gurgaon as his condition deteriorated"
A CT scan disclosed that large extra-dural haematoma was found in the frontal region with mass effect and Sukhbir needed urgent surgery and he was operated upon and the large extra-dural haematoma was removed
"Dr. Pardeep Kumar (PW-2) also examined the other injured persons, PW 5-Jagdish and PW"
6- Mange Ram
"Statement of Jagdish was recorded, based on which F.I.R. was registered at Police Station Taoru, Gurgaon under Sections 323, 324, 325 and 307 read with S. 34 IPC"
PW 8-Ramesh Kumar (ASI) had taken up the investigation
"He examined the witnesses and after completion of investigation, challan was filed under Sections 307, 325, 324 read with S. 34 IPC"
"In the trial court, prosecution examined nine witnesses including Jagdish-PW5, Mange Ram-PW6 and Dr. Prem Kumar-PW2 and Dr. HiIol Kanti Pal-PW9"
"Neuro Surgeon, PW8-investigating officer and other witnesses"
The accused were examined u/s
313 Cr
P.C. about the incriminating evidence and circumstances
First accused Jage Ram pleaded that on the date of occurrence-complainant party Jagdish and his sons Mange Ram and Sukhbir forcibly trespassed into the land belonging to the accused and attempted to forcibly cut the pullas
Jagdish further claims that he along with Rakesh caused injuries to the complainant party in exercise of right of private defence of property
He has denied that Rajesh and Usha had seen the incident
Raju (A-2) and Madan (A-3) stated that they were not present on the spot and they have been falsely implicated
Rakesh (A-4) adopted the stand of his father Jage Ram
"Upon consideration of oral and documentary evidence, the learned Additional Sessions Judge vide judgment dated 17.2.2000 convicted all the accused persons u/ss"
307 and 325 IPC and sentenced them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for five years and one year respectively and a fine of Rs
500/- each with default clause
"Aggrieved by the said judgment, the accused-appellants filed criminal appeal before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana"
The High Court vide impugned judgment dated 19.8.2011 modified the judgment of the trial court thereby convicted Jage Ram (A-1) u/s
"325 IPC and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year, convicted second accused Rajbir"
Raju u/s
307 IPC and imposed sentence of imprisonment for five years as well the fine of Rs.500/- was confirmed by the High Court
Sentence u/s
325 IPC (two counts) was modified as the sentence u/s
323 IPC and he was sentenced to undergo six months rigorous imprisonment
Both the sentences were ordered to run concurrently
High Court modified the sentence of Madan (A-3) Rakesh (A-4) u/s. 323 IPC and sentenced them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months (two counts) respectively
"In this appeal, the appellants assail the correctness of the impugned judgment"
"Ms. Vibha Datta Makhija, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants contended that the evidence of the witnesses suffers from material discrepancy and is self- contradictory"
"It was submitted that injured witness Sukhbir was not examined in the court and neither CT Scan nor x-ray nor operational notes of Sukhbir were produced before the court and in the absence of such material evidence, courts below erred in convicting the second accused u/s"
307 IPC
"Additionally, the learned counsel contended that the defence plea of private defence was not considered by the courts below in proper perspective"
"Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the respondent-State contended that the evidence of all the witnesses satisfactorily establishes the overt act of the accused persons and Jagdish (PW-5) and Mange Ram (PW-6) being the injured witnesses, the veracity of these witnesses cannot be doubted"
"It was submitted that the medical evidence sufficiently corroborated the oral evidence and the prosecution has established the intention of the 2nd accused in causing attempt to commit murder of Sukhbir and in appreciation of the evidence, courts below recorded concurrent findings convicting the second accused u/s"
307 IPC and the same warrants no interference
We have carefully considered the rival contentions and gone through the impugned judgment and perused the materials on record
"As it emerges from the evidence, complainant Jagdish (PW-5) and his two sons Sukhbir and Mange Ram were cutting pullas"
The accused party went there and asked them not to cut the pullas
"In the wordy altercation, second accused Rajbir"
Raju gave pharsi blows on the head of Sukhbir
PWs 5 & 6 have clearly spoken about the overt act of the accused that A-1 Jage Ram attacked and caused injury to PW-5 Jagdish with jaily blows and that second accused Rajbir
Raju attacked on the head of Sukhbir with pharsi
They have also stated that Madan and Rakesh caused injuries to PW5-Jagdish with lathi on shoulder and left elbow respectively
PW
2- Dr. Pardeep Kumar in his evidence stated that he has examined PWs 5 and 6 and noted the injuries on the body of PWs 5 and 6 and issued wound certificates
Evidence of PWs 5 and 6 is amply corroborated by medical evidence
"PWs 5 and 6 being injured witnesses, their evidence is entitled to great weight"
Cogent and convincing grounds are required to discard the evidence of injured witnesses
"In the light of the fact that PWs 5 and 6 were injured witnesses, courts below tested their evidence for its credibility and recorded concurrent findings that PWs 5 and 6 are trustworthy witnesses"
We find no reason to take a different view
Appellants have raised the contention that the prosecution failed to adduce evidence that A-2 Rajbir attempted to commit murder of Sukhbir
"It was submitted that injured person Sukhbir was neither examined nor medical evidence like CT Scan, x-ray and operational notes and Sukhbir were produced to corroborate the oral evidence and while so courts below erred in convicting second accused Rajbir"
"Dr. Pardeep Kumar-PW-2, who examined Sukhbir found during his medico-legal examination a lacerated wound in the middle of the top of the skull"
"Injured-Sukhkbir was found vomiting in the hospital and he was examined by a Neuro Surgeon Dr. Hilol Kanti Pal (PW-9) of Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi on 19.11.1994, i.e. the day after the incident"
PW-9 has stated that Sukhbir was unconscious since 2.00 P.M. on 18.11.1994 and was deeply comatose with irregularity of pupils and a laceration was diagnosed on the right front parietal region
"Further, PW-9 has stated that during the CT scan, it was revealed that a large extra-dural haemotoma was present in the frontal region with mass effect and to avoid further deterioration of his condition, he was operated upon by frontal trephine craniopmy an haemotoma measuring about 125 ml was evacuated"
PW-9
"stated that had not the operation been conducted on Sukhbir and had not the extra-dural haemotoma removed by operation urgently, the head injury caused to Sukhbir would have caused his death"
"As noted by the High Court, it is thus brought on evidence that had not surgical assistance been given to Sukhbir, he would have definitely died"
For the purpose of conviction u/s
"307 IPC, prosecution has to establish (i) the intention to commit murder and (ii) the act done by the accused"
The burden is on the prosecution that accused had attempted to commit the murder of the prosecution witness
Whether the accused person intended to commit murder of another person would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case
To justify a conviction u/s
"307 IPC, it is not essential that fatal injury capable of causing death should have been caused"
"Although the nature of injury actually caused may be of assistance in coming to a finding as to the intention of the accused, such intention may also be adduced from other circumstances"
"The intention of the accused is to be gathered from the circumstances like the nature of the weapon used, words used by the accused at the time of the incident, motive of the accused, parts of the body where the injury was caused and the nature of injury and severity of the blows given etc"
In the case of State of M.P. vs. Kashiram & Ors
AIR 2009
SC 1642
"2009) 4 SCC 26 2009 Indlaw SC 92, the scope of intention for attracting conviction u/s"
307 IPC was elaborated and it was held as under
It is sufficient to justify a conviction u/s
307 if there is present an intent coupled with some overt act in execution thereof
It is not essential that bodily injury capable of causing death should have been inflicted
"The section makes a distinction between the act of the accused and its result, if any"
"The court has to see whether the act, irrespective of its result, was done with the intention or knowledge and under circumstances mentioned in the section"
"Therefore, an accused charged u/s"
307 IPC cannot be acquitted merely because the injuries inflicted on the victim were in the nature of a simple hurt
"This position was highlighted in State of Maharashtra v. Balram Bama Patil, (1983) 2 SCC 28 1983 Indlaw SC 414, Girija Shanker v. State of U.P.(2004) 3 SCC 793 2004 Indlaw SC 78 and R. Prakash v. State of Karnataka (2004) 9 SCC 27 2004 Indlaw SC 117"
Whether there was intention to kill or knowledge that death will be caused is a question of fact and would depend on the facts of a given case
The circumstances that the injury inflicted by the accused was simple or minor will not by itself rule out application of S. 307 IPC
"The determinative question is the intention or knowledge, as the case may be, and not the nature of the injury"
State of M.P. v. Saleem (2005) 5 SCC 554 2005 Indlaw SC 413 Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system to undermine the public confidence in the efficacy of law and society could not long endure under such serious threats
"It is, therefore, the duty of every court to award proper sentence having regard to the nature of the offence and the manner in which it was executed or committed, etc"
This position was illuminatingly stated by this Court in Sevaka Perumal v. State of T.N.(1991) 3 SCC 471 1991 Indlaw SC 683
"Having regard to the weapon used for causing the head injuries to Sukhbir, nature of injures, situs of the injury and the severity of the blows, courts below recorded concurrent findings convicting the 2nd appellant u/s"
"In our considered view, the conviction of the second appellant Rajbir"
307 IPC is unassailable
"Learned counsel for the appellants contended that the second appellant is in custody for more than three years and since the occurrence was in the year 1994, prayed for reduction of the sentence imposed on the second appellant to the period already undergone"
"Placing reliance upon the judgment of this Court in Hari Singh vs. Sukhbir Singh & Ors (1988) 4 SCC 551 1988 Indlaw SC 27., learned counsel for the appellants additionally submitted that in terms of S. 357 (3) Cr"
P.C. that the compensation may be awarded to the victim and the sentence be modified to the period already undergone
For the conviction u/s
"307 IPC, courts below imposed upon the 2nd appellant rigorous imprisonment of five years, while imposing punishment, courts have an obligation to award appropriate punishment"
Question of awarding sentence is a matter of discretion and the same has to be exercised by the courts taking into consideration all the relevant circumstances
"What sentence would meet the ends of justice would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case and the courts must keep in mind the gravity of the offence, motive for the crime, nature of the offence and all other attendant circumstances"
Vide State of M.P. vs. Bablu Natt (2009) 2 SCC 272 2008 Indlaw SC 2027; Alister Anthony Pareira vs. State of Maharashtra (2012) 2 SCC 648 2012 Indlaw SC 12 and Soman vs. State of Kerala (2013) 11 SCC 382 2012 Indlaw SC
"In the light of the above, considering the case in hand, the occurrence was of the year 1994 when the complainant party was cutting pullas, the accused asked them not to cut the pullas which resulted in the wordy altercation"
"In the heat of passion, the accused have caused injuries to the complainant party"
The second accused Rajbir
Raju is in custody
"He surrendered on 5.1.2012 and is stated to be in custody since then, for more than three years"
"Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, in our considered view, the period of sentence of five years may be reduced to three years apart from directing the second appellant Rajbir"
Raju to pay substantial compensation to injured-Sukhbir
"As noticed above, injured-Sukhbir sustained grievous head injuries and was deeply comatose and was in a state of shock and trauma"
Learned counsel for the injured-witness submitted that for quite some time injured-Sukhbir was unconscious and thereafter suffering from mental trauma
"Having regard to the nature of injuries sustained by Sukhbir and the period of treatment and other circumstances, we are of the view that, it would be appropriate to direct second appellant- accused Rajbir"
"Raju to pay Rs.7,50,000/- as compensation to the injured-Sukhbir"
"When the matter came up for hearing on 14.10.2014, learned counsel for the appellants informed the Court that he had offered Rs.5,00,000/- by way of demand draft towards compensation to the injured-Sukhbir in the presence of the Sarpanch of the village which he has refused to receive the same"
"The said amount of Rs.5,00,000/- is now kept in fixed deposit in the Registry of this Court"
For inflicting blows on PW-5 Jagidsh with jaily A-1 Jage Ram was convicted u/s
325 IPC and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year. A-3 and A-4 have also given lathis blows to PW-5 and were convicted u/s. 323 IPC and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months by the High Court
"Having regard to the fact that the occurrence was of the year 1994, considering the other facts and circumstances of the case, the sentence of imprisonment imposed on Jage Ram (A-1), Madan (A-3) and Rakesh (A-4) is reduced to the period already undergone by them"
The conviction of A-1 u/s
"325 IPC, A-3 and A- 4 u/s"
323 IPC is confirmed and the sentence is reduced to the period already undergone by each of them
The conviction of second accused Rajbir
"307 IPC is confirmed and the sentence of imprisonment of five years is reduced to the period already undergone and additionally the second accused shall pay a compensation of Rs.7,50,000/- to the injured witness-Sukhbir"
"Compensation amount of Rs.5,00,000/- deposited in this Court by the 2nd appellant shall be paid to the injured witness-Sukhbir"
"Raju shall deposit the balance compensation amount of Rs.2,50,000/- before the trial court within three months from the date of this judgment and on such deposit, the same shall also be paid to the injured witness-Sukhbir"
"On failure to deposit the balance compensation, the second appellant Rajbir"
Raju shall undergo default sentence of one year
The appeal is allowed to the above said extent
Second appellant Rajbir
Raju is ordered to be released forthwith if not required in any other case
"Bail bonds of accused A1, A3 and A4 shall stand discharged"
Appeal allowed
This appeal by special leave is directed against order dated 13.7.2005 passed by the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court
"Dismissing Letter Patents Appeal preferred by the appellant against the order of the learned Single Judge who dismissed his writ petition and confirmed the orders passed by the State Minister for Revenue in the proceeding R.T.S.3402/ Pra.kra.309/L-6 dated 18th October,2002"
It is the appellant's case that his father Shri Nawoosingh Panjumal Panjwani was a displaced person who migrated from Pakistan to India during the period of partition and the appellant's family while in Pakistan was having agricultural land over there admeasuring 4 acres 10 gunthas
"After migration,the family took shelter at Refugee Camp of Pimpri,Pune in Maharashtra"
"In view of enactment of Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act,1954 by the Union of India,the immovable properties left behind by Muslims who had migrated to Pakistan were acquired and the same was distributed to displaced persons as a ""compensation pool"".Accordingly,father of the appellant was allotted a land admeasuring 2 acres 5 gunthas bearing Revenue Survey Nos.351 and 118/2 situated at Village Lonavala,Taluka Maval,District Pune"
It has been pleaded by the appellant that Survey No.118/1 and 118/2 are one and the same thing
"The facts in brief,as narrated in the impugned order,are that Survey Nos.118,328 and 351 of Lonavala were originally owned by one Haji Habib Tar Mohammed Janu"
"The said Haji Habib Tar Mohammed Janu migrated to Pakistan and while going to Pakistan,he sold his property to one Smt"
"Hajrabi Haji Yusuf on 4.6.1949.However,this transaction was cancelled by the Collector and Custodian of Evacuee Property on 17.4.1949 as per Section 8(i) of the Evacuee Properties Act and these lands were accordingly entered as Evacuee Property by the Tahsildar,Maval on 26.10.1949.It appears that these survey numbers were also given C.T.S.No.129,130-A,130-B and 133"
"It appears that in CTS No.129,130-A,130-B and 133,apart from vacant land there is a bungalow No.52-Habib Villa"
"It appears that the Regional Settlement Commissioner placed this property for auction through Government Auctioner and one Gulabbai Desaipurchased the said property in auction for a consideration of Rs.16,750/-on 17.5.1956 and,accordingly,sale certificate was issued by the Regional Settlement Commissioner,Bombay on behalf of the Government"
"In the said sale certificate the C.T.S.No 129,130-A,130-B and 133 of Village Lonavala were mentioned"
The area of this CTS Nos.were as under
"On the basis of the said sale certificate the mutation Entry No.1836 was effected in the village record in favour of Gulabai Desai,and thereby her name was entered in Survey Nos.118/1B and 328 of village Lonavala to the extent of 29.30 Ares and 70 Ares respectively"
"Thereafter,Gulabai sold CTS No.133 admeasuring 33 Gunthas on 24.4.1977 to Respondent No.3 Genu Kadu"
"The said Gulabai also gifted her remaining area from this Survey numbers to her grandson Anil Gajanan Desai on 15.1.1979,who in turn has sold his properties to Respondent no.2"
Prem Hasmatraj Lalwani in the year 1980
"The Survey Nos.118/2 and 351,being Evacuee Properties,were allotted to the Appellant in the year 1956.Later on,it was found that the Appellant is in possession of more area and,therefore,the said order was modified on 6.5.1982 and excess area was granted to the Appellant on payment of Rs.31,360/-,which Appellant had paid on 17.5.1982 in Government Treasury and thereby the Deputy Collector and Assistant Settlement Commissioner,Pune granted the excess land to the Appellant,and thereafter the dispute started between the parties"
"In the impugned order,Division Bench made it clear that since the dispute between the parties was in respect of the area,as to what has been purchased in auction sale by Gulabai Desai and what is the area allotted to the Appellant by the orders of the Deputy Collector and Deputy Custodian of Evacuee Properties,the Appellant requested the Bench not to enter into the merits on this question in this LPA since the parties may prosecute their remedies in the Civil Court for such adjudication,and therefore,that aspect was not considered by the High Court"
"However,in the facts of the conflicting claims,the Appellant made grievance to the Deputy Collector and the Deputy Custodian of Evacuee Properties in respect of the Mutation made in favour of the Respondent Gulabai and other Respondents and,therefore,by order dated 18.9.1984 the Deputy Collector and Deputy Custodian of Evacuee Properties,Pune,directed the Sub-Divisional Officer,Haveli Sub Division to take up the case in revision under Section 257 of Maharashtra Land Revenue Code and pass necessary orders"
"In view of these directions,the Sub-Divisional Officer,Haveli,Sub Division,Pune,initiated proceeding RTS Revision 14 of 1984 and by order dated 30.7.1985 cancelled the mutation Entry No.1836 which comprises land admeasuring 7897 sq.yards and directed necessary corrections in the record as per the observations made in the order"
It appears that the said order was taken in appeal by the respondent and the matter was remanded to the Sub Divisional Officer
"After remand,the Sub Divisional Officer,conducted inquiry and again passed an order on 29.10.1987 and confirmed the earlier order"
"Therefore,the RTS Appeal No.128 of 1987 was preferred before the Collector,which was disposed off by the Additional Collector on 13.7.1993.By the said order,the Order of the third Sub-Divisional Officer was maintained"
"However,further inquiry as directed by the SDO was to be conducted"
"Since the mutation Entry No.1836 was cancelled by above order,the Talathi gave effect to these orders and effected the mutation Entry No.2176 and showed the disputed properties in the name of the Collector and Deputy Custodian of Evacuee Properties"
The directions were issued by the Collector to the Tahsildar to place the appellant in possession of the property as per the orders of the Deputy Collector and the Deputy Custodian of Evacuee Properties
"However,instead of giving effect to those orders,it appears that the Revenue Officers at Tahsil level effected two mutations,viz,Mutation No.2377 and 2394.By mutation entry No.2377 the name of respondent was again mutated in the record and by the mutation Entry No.2394 the name of Genu Kadu was mutated in the record"
"Since the Collector noticed on complaint that the orders of the Collector has been bypassed or surpassed by the Subordinate Revenue Officers,the Collector by order dated 12.7.1999 directed the SDO to take these mutations namely mutation Entry No.2377 and 2394 in revision and therefore the Sub-Divisional Officer,Maval Division has taken these mutations in revision bearing RTS Revision No.12 of 1999.The said revision was decided by the Sub Divisional officer at Maval on 28.1.2000 and those mutations were cancelled"
"Being aggrieved by the order passed in the said revision,Respondent No.2 Lalwani preferred RTS Appeal No.81 of 2000 and the Respondent No.3 Genu Kadu preferred RTS Appeal No.114 of 2000.Both"
"these RTS Appeals were heard by the Additional Collector,Pune and by order dated 28.5.2001 the Addl"
"Collector,Pune dismissed the said appeals and confirmed the order of the Sub Divisional Officer,Maval"
"Aggrieved by the said order of the Additional Collector,Respondent No.2 preferred RTS Revision No.330 of 2001 under Section 257 of Maharashtra Land Revenue Code,1966 before the Additional Commissioner,Pune Division,Pune"
"The said revision was decided by the Additional Commissioner,Pune by order dated 22.11.2001 and the said revision was dismissed"
"Respondent No.2 challenged this order of the Additional Commissioner by filing the proceeding RTS 3402/Pra.kra.309/L-6 by way of second revision before the Revenue Minister for State and the said proceeding was decided by the Minister for State on 18.10.2002.The Revenue Minister allowed the said proceeding and set aside the orders passed by the Sub Divisional Officer,Maval dated 28.1.2000,order dated 28.5.2001 of Additional Collector,Pune and of Additional Commissioner dated 22.11.2001,and thus,restored the position as reflected by the Mutation Entries Nos.1836 and 2377 and 2394.Thus,all the entries in favour of the Respondents were protected and maintained by the order of the State Minister for Revenue"
"Appellant challenged the order dated 19.10.2002 passed by the Minister by filing a writ petition,which was dismissed by learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court"
"Thereafter,the appellant filed Letters Patent Appeal,which was also dismissed by the Division Bench holding that when the State Minister for Revenue entertained the matter,he was possessed of jurisdiction under Section 257 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code and,therefore,the order passed by him under the said authority is within his jurisdiction,power and competence"
The Division Bench observed thus
We record our finding
that under Section 257 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code more than one revision is possible
"Now coming to the facts of the present case,the mutation Entry No.1836 was in fact certified"
"However,the Sub-Divisional Officer has taken the said mutation in revision in RTS Revision No.14 of 1984 and has set aside the mutation by order dated 30.7.1985.There was appeal as against that order which was remanded"
It was again decided by the Sub Divisional Officer on 29.10.1987 and the said mutation was set aside
There was RTS Appeal No.128 of 1987 which was decided on 13.7.1993.In view of these orders the mutation entry No.1836 was cancelled and Mutation Entry No.2176 was effected whereby the name of the Collector and the Deputy Collector of the Evacuee Property was entered into 7 X 12 extracts
"It is further found that when the orders of the Collector directing to put the petitioner into possession were not obeyed by the subordinate Revenue Officers and the Revenue Officers effected the mutation entry No.2377 in favour of the Respondent Nos.3 Gulabai Desai and Mutation Entry No.2394 in favour of the Respondent No.5 Genu Kadu and thereafter for second time the special Divisional Officer,Maval,has exercised the revisional powers under Section 257 and initiated proceeding RTS Revision 12 of 1999 in respect of the mutation entry No.2377 and 2394.The RTS Revision 12/99 was allowed on 28.1.2000 as against that two RTS appeals namely,RTS Appeal No.81 of 2000 and RTS Appeal No.114 of 2000 were preferred by the Respondent"
They were decided on 28.5.2001.As against that the RTS Revision No.330 of 2001 was preferred
The same was dismissed
As against that the RTS proceeding bearing No.3402 /Pra
Kra.309/L-6 was preferred before the Minister for State
"All these proceedings will show that twice the Sub-Divisional Officer has exercised the revisional power under Section 257 at the directions of the Collector,namely the RTS Revision No.14 of 1984 and RTS Revision No.12 of 1999.It will further reveal that the appeals as against the RTS Revision No.14 of 1984 was preferred by the parties in view of the provisions of Section 247 and 249 sub-section 2.It will equally appear that when the orders were passed in Revision Application No.12 of 1999 before the Sub Divisional Officer in exercise of the powers under Section 257 the parties have preferred two RTS appeals in view of the provisions of Section 247 and 249 sub-section 2.Not only that,thereafter the RTS Revision Application No.330 of 2001 was also preferred before the Commissioner and if the view is taken that the second revision is not tenable then in that circumstances since the first order passed in RTS Revision No.12 of 1999 is a revisional order,this second revision before the Commissioner being RTS Revision No.330 of 2001 would not have been tenable"
"However,said revision RTS 330 of 2001 is tenable since the appeals as provided under Section 247 and 249 intervene in between the revisional orders passed by the Sub-Divisional officer and the Commissioner"
"Thus,in short,we find that the scheme under Maharashtra Land Revenue Code is quite different scheme and it permits more than one revision"
"Thus,viewed from any angle,we find that the State Minister for Revenue when he entertained the matter,State Minister for revenue was possessed of jurisdiction under Section 257 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code and therefore the order passed by him under the said authority is within his jurisdiction,power and competence"
"Hence,the present appeal by special leave"
Mr
"Huzefa Ahmadi,learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant,mainly attacked the revisional power exercised by the Minister concerned in purported exercise of jurisdiction under Section 257 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code"
"In the alternative,learned Senior counsel submitted that even if it were to be admitted without prejudice that second revision is maintainable,the Minister being the revisional authority should not have interfered with the findings recorded by all the six Revenue Authorities"
Referring the decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of Sambappa vs
"State of Maharashtra [(2002) SCC on line,Bombay 1222],learned counsel submitted that when the Sub-Divisional Officer,Additional Collector and Additional Commissioner had concurrently recorded finding in favour of the appellant by observing that the revenue record is not in consonance with the factual aspect and they have directed to correct the revenue entries,in such a case,the second revisional authority exceeded its jurisdiction in entertaining the said application and interfering with the finding of fact"
Section 257 makes it clear that a revisional authority has to consider only the legality and propriety of the decision
"Learned counsel referring the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure tried to impress us that when the power of revision is given to the District Judge,then the High Court cannot entertain second revision petition under Section 115 of the Code"
Learned counsel relied upon the decision of this Court in the case of State of Kerala vs
"K.M.Charia Abdulla & Co.,AIR 1965"

"Rao Girdhari Lal Chowdhury,AIR 1963 SC 698 1961 Indlaw SC 157"
"Ahmadi,learned senior counsel further submitted that a request was made to the High Court not to enter into the merit of the case,and to confine itself to the question whether a second revision was at all maintainable,in the light of the ratio in Harishankar's case 1961"

that a second revision to the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr
P.C.was not permitted
"Lastly,Mr"
"Ahmadi submitted that the second revision would not lie under Section 257 of the Revenue Code since Section 259 of the Code provides an opportunity to the State Government to only correct any ""Final Order"" while exercising power under the provisions of Section 257 i.e.with regard to its legality and propriety"
"Ravindra Srivastava,learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent-State,at the very outset submitted that the appellant conceded before the High Court not to decide the merit of the case"
The only point raised before the High Court was with regard to the maintainability of second revision before the State Government under Section 257 of the Revenue Code
Learned counsel submitted that Section 257 expressly confers power of revision on the State Government which power is coupled with power of control and superintendence
Learned counsel submitted that the Commissioner or the Additional Commissioner is not equal in a rank but subordinate to the State Government
Learned counsel submitted that the State Government is the supreme revenue authority and existence of more than one appeal or revision to an aggrieved party is not per se abhorrent to any legal principle; depends upon the Statute
Srivastava then contended that the High Court correctly analysed and appreciated the scheme of the Code vis a vis judicial review in revenue matters
Learned counsel put heavy reliance on the decision of this Court in the case of Ishwar Singh vs
"State of Rajasthan and others,(2005"
2 SCC 334 2005 Indlaw SC 6 for the proposition that there can be a second revision under the same provision of the Statute
The only question that falls for consideration is as to whether a second revision under Section 257 is maintainable and that whether the State Government exceeds its jurisdiction in entertaining the second revision
"Before we proceed to decide the aforesaid question,we would like to refer the relevant provisions of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code 1966"
"Section 2(31) defines the Revenue Officer as under:- ""2 (31)"" revenue officer"" means every officer of any rank whatsoever appointed under any of the provisions of this Code,and employed in or about the business of the land revenue or of the surveys,assessment,accounts,or records connected therewith"
"Chapter II deals with the Revenue Officers,their powers and duties"
"Sections 5,6 and 7 reads as under:- ""5.Chief Controlling authority in revenue matters"
"The chief controlling authority in all matters connected with the land revenue in his division shall vest in the Commissioner,subject to the superintendence,direction and control of the State Government"
6.Revenue Officers in division
"The State Government shall appoint a Commissioner of each division; and may appoint in a division an Additional Commissioner and so many Assistant Commissioners as may be expedient,to assist the Commissioner: Provided that,nothing in this section shall preclude the appointment of the same officer as Commissioner for two or more divisions"
7.Revenue officers in district.(1)The State Government shall appoint a Collector for each district (including the City of Bombay who shall be in charge of the revenue administration there of; and a Tahsildar for each taluka who shall be the chief officer entrusted with the local revenue administration of a taluka
"The State Government may appoint one or more Additional Collectors and in each district (including the City of Bombay and so many Assistant Collectors and Deputy Collectors (with such designations such as ""First"",""Second"",Super numerary"",etc"
"Assistants as may be expressed in the order of their appointment),one or more Naib-Tahsildars in a taluka,and one or more Additional Tahsidars or Naib-Tahsildars therein and such other persons (having such designations) to assist the revenue officers as it may deem expedient"
"3) Subject to the general orders of the State Government,the Collector may place any Assistant or Deputy Collector in charge of one more sub-divisions of a district,or may himself retain charge thereof"
Such Assistant or Deputy Collector may also be called a Sub-Divisional Officer
"The Collector may appoint to each district as many persons as he thinks fit to be Circle Officers and Circle Inspectors to be in charge of a Circle,and one or more Talathis for a saza,and one or more Kotwals or other village servants for each village or group of villages,as he may deem fit"
Section 11 of the Code is worth to be quoted herein
"below:- ""11.Subordination of officers"
1) All revenue officers shall be subordinate to the State Government
"2) Unless the State Government directs otherwise,all revenue officers in a division shall be subordinate to the Commissioner,and all revenue Officers 2[in a district (including the City of Bombay)] shall be subordinate to the Collector"
"3)Unless the State Government directs otherwise,all other Revenue Officers Including survey officers shall be subordinated,the one to the other,in such order as the State Government may direct"
Sections 13 and 14 deal with the powers and duties of all Revenue Officers
"From reading of the aforesaid provisions,it is manifest that the State Government makes appointment of the Revenue Officers including the Commissioner and the Chief Controlling Authorities in the revenue matters"
"Section 5 makes it clear that the Chief Controlling Authority in all matters connected with the land revenue in his Division shall vest with the Commissioner,subject to superintendence,directions and control of the State Government"
Section 11 provides that all Revenue Officers shall be subordinate to the State Government
"It is,therefore,clear that in revenue matters the State Government is the Supreme Revenue Authority"
"In the present case,we noticed the scheme of the Code in the matters of hearing and disposal of appeals,revision and review"
"Section 247 deals with the appeal and appellate authorities,which reads as under:- ""247.Appeal and appellate authorities"
"In the absence of any express provisions of this Code,or of any law for the time being in force to the contrary,an appeal shall lie from any decision or order passed by a revenue or survey officer specified in column 1 of the Schedule E under this Code or any other law for the time being in force to the officer specified in column 2 of that Schedule whether or not such decision or order may itself have been passed on appeal from the decision of order of the officer specified in column 1 of the said Schedule"
"Provided that,in no case the number of appeals shall exceed two"
"2) When on account of promotion of change of designation,an appeal against any decision or order lies under this section to the same officer who has passed the decision or order appealed against,the appeal shall lie to such other officer competent to decide the appeal to whom it may be transferred under the provisions of this Code"
Section 248 is also relevant which provides the forum of appeal to the State Government
"Similarly,Section 249 makes provision of appeal against the review or revision"
The schedule preferred to in Section 227 mentions the Authorities before whom appeal would lie
The Schedule appended to the Code is as follows:- Schedule E (See section 247
Section 257 is the relevant provision which deals with the power of State Government and of certain revenue and survey officers to call for and examine the records and proceedings of Subordinate Officers
"Section 257 reads as under:- ""257.Power of State Government and of certain revenue and survey officers to call for and examine records and proceedings of subordinate officers"
"The State Government and any revenue of survey officer,not inferior in rank to an Assistant or Deputy Collector or a Superintendent of Land Records,in their respective departments,may call for and examine the record of any inquiry or the proceedings of any subordinate revenue or survey officer,for the purpose of satisfying itself or himself,as the case may be,as to the legality or propriety of any decision or order passed,and as to the regularity of the proceedings of such officer"
"A Tahsildar,a Naib-Tahsildar,and a District Inspector of Land Records"
may in the same manner call for and examine the proceedings of any officer subordinate to them in any matter in which neither a formal nor a summary inquiry has been held
"3) If in any case,it shall appear to the State Government,or any officer referred to in sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) that any decision or order or proceedings so called for should be modified,annulled or reversed,it or he may pass such order thereon as it or he deems fit"
"Provided that,the State Government or such officer shall not vary or reverse any order affecting any question of right between private persons without having to the parties interested notice to appear and to be heard in support of such order"
"Provided further that,an Assistant of Deputy Collector shall not himself pass such order in any matter in which a formal inquiry has been held,but shall submit the record with his opinion to the Collector,who shall pall such order thereon as he may deem fit"
A bare reading of the aforesaid provision would show that the provision uses the word 'and' for State Government but for other Revenue officers
it uses the word 'or'.The language and the words used in the said provision suggest that jurisdiction of the State Government is concurrent with the jurisdiction of other Revenue officers in deciding the revision
"Hence,even if one party goes to the Commissioner in revision,the State Government can still be approached under Section 257 for revision"
The power of revision exercised by any Revenue officer including the Commissioner is a proceeding by a subordinate officer and the State Government can satisfy itself as to the legality and propriety of any decision including the order passed in revision by the Revenue officers
"Further,in view of the fact that State Government itself appoints the Revenue officers including the Commissioner under the scheme of the Code and all Revenue officers are subordinate to the State Government as per Section 11 of the Act,and even the Chief Controlling Authority in all matters connected with the land revenue in his Division is vested with the Commissioner,they are subject to the superintendence,direction and control of the State Government as provided under Section 5 of the Code"
"The power of the State Government has further been widened by Section 259 of the Code,which reads as under:- ""259.Rules as to decisions or orders expressly made final Whenever in this Code,it is provided that a decision or order shall be final or conclusive,such provision shall mean that no appeal lies from any such decision or order; but it shall be lawful to the State Government alone to modify,annul or reverse any such decision or order under the provision of Section 257"
"The aforesaid provision makes it clear that even if the decision is considered to be final,the State Government's power to call for and examine the record and proceedings of subordinate officers is saved"
"In other words,the State Government in exercise of its revisional as well as general power of superintendence and control can call for any record of proceedings and consider the legality and propriety of the orders passed by the Revenue officers under Section 247 or 257 of the Code"
"From perusal of the entire scheme of the Code including Section 257,it is manifest that the revisional powers are not only exercisable by the State Government but also by certain other Revenue officers"
"There is nothing in the Code to suggest that if these revisional powers are exercised by a Revenue officer who has jurisdiction,it cannot be further exercised by a superior Revenue officer or by the State Government"
"A fair reading of Sections 257 and 259 suggests that if revisional powers are exercised by a Revenue officer having jurisdiction to do so,further revisional power can be exercised by the superior officer or by the State Government"
A similar question came for consideration before this Court in the case of Ishwar Singh vs
"2 SCC 334 under the Rajasthan Cooperative Societies Act,1965.In that Ac,t by Section 128 power was conferred upon the State Government and the Registrar to call for and examine the records of any enquiry or proceedings of any other matter,of any officer subordinate to them,for the purpose of satisfying themselves as to the legality or propriety of any decision or order passed by such officer"
It was submitted by the counsel that Section 128 related to two authorities i.e.the State Government and the Registrar
In fact the two authorities are interchangeable
"If one authority exercises revisional power,the other authority logically cannot have exercised such power"
"Hence,it was argued that second revision was not maintainable"
"Rejecting the submission this Court held:- ""20.Sub-section (2) of Section 124 provides that if the decision or order is made by the Registrar,appeal lies to the Government and if the decision or order is made by any other person,or a cooperative society,the appeal lies to the Registrar"
"Therefore,under Chapter XIII a clear distinction is made between the State Government and the Registrar"
The test is whether the two authorities with concurrent revisional jurisdiction are equal in rank
"It is,therefore,not correct as contended by learned counsel for the appellant that the two authorities i.e.the State Government and the Registrar are interchangeable"
The power of the Government and the Registrar in terms of Section 128 excludes matters which are covered by Section 125 i.e.revision by the Tribunal
"Considering the entire scheme of the Code,and the provisions contained in Sections 257 and 259,we are of the definite opinion that the Minister concerned of the State Government can entertain second revision to satisfy the legality and propriety of the order passed by the Revenue Officer"
The Division Bench of the Bombay High Court has elaborately discussed the question and passed the impugned order holding that Section 257 confers jurisdiction to the State Government to entertain its revision against the order passed by any Revenue Officer either in appeal or in revision
We find no infirmity in the impugned order passed by the High Court
"Hence,this appeal has no merit which is accordingly dismissed"
"Before parting with the order,we must make it clear that in view of the request made by the appellant before the High Court not to enter into the merit of the case since the party may prosecute their remedies in the Civil Court for adjudication,we have not expressed any opinion with regard to the merit of the case of the parties"
The parties may prosecute their remedies in Civil Court in accordance with law
Petition dismissed
"1.  These civil appeals by special leave are directed against the judgment and order of the High Court of Allahabad, declaring section 10(3) of the Uttar Pradesh Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1997 (for short ""the 1997 Act"") as ultra vires articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. "
The facts lie within a narrow compass and they are as follows: 
2.  Sukhpal Singh is the owner of a tanker bearing registration No. 
"The said tanker is covered by national permit granted by the Regional Transport Authority, Durg. "
"The national permit granted was for Chattisgarh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. "
Sukhpal was granted an authorization certificate on the basis of the national permit valid up to 14.2.2003. 
"3.  On 26.2.2002, while carrying goods from Bhilai Steel Plant to Sonepat, the tanker in question entered the State of U.P and after unloading the goods returned from Sonepat. "
"While doing so, the tanker crossed the U.P. border at Masaura and when it was about 8 kms. "
"in the State of M.P., the vehicle was seized by the Assistant Regional Transport Officer, Lalitpur on 4.3.2002. "
"4.  On 5.3.2002, Sukhpal made an application for release of his vehicle on which the Assistant RTO passed an order directing Sukhpal to pay Rs.5100/ as composite tax plus ten times penalty under section 10(3) of the said1997 Act, as amended by U.P. Amending Act No.25 of 2001. "
"5.  The order of penalty was challenged by Sukhpal vide writ petition in the High Court of Allahabad, in which the validity of section 10(3) was put in issue. "
We have quoted the facts in the case of Sukhpal as a representative matter in the group of similar matters. 
"Shobha Dixit, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant-State submitted that on account of huge evasion of tax, the legislature had to enact section 10(3) providing for a deterrent penalty as the State of U.P. has a vast boundary and the vehicles could enter from distant corners without payment of statutory dues at the entry point. "
Learned counsel pointed out that drivers would carry demand drafts in their pockets and they did not pay the taxes (including additional tax) till they were apprehended and when apprehended they made an excuse of paucity of collection centres. 
"She contended that the aforestated defaults constituted tax evasion and, therefore, the State Legislature incorporated section 10(3) into existing section 10 by Amending Act No.25 of 2001 imposing ten times penalty. "
"Learned counsel next contended that the vehicle in question was ""goods carriage"" operating under national permit granted under section 88(12) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (for short the  ""M.V. Act, 1988"") and, therefore, it was liable to pay additional tax at the rate applicable to such ""goods carriage"" under part 'B' of the third schedule [See: section 5(1)(b) of the 1997 Act]. "
"7.  Learned counsel submitted that under section 5, additional tax has been levied on goods carriage plying under permits granted by the authorities within UP, goods carriage operating under national permit granted under section 88(12) of the M.V. Act, 1988 and goods carriage plying under permits granted by authorities outside Uttar Pradesh for inter-State route partly lying in Uttar Pradesh and, therefore, there was no discrimination to the levy of additional tax. "
"Learned counsel further contended that under section 9(1)(iii) of the 1997 Act, additional tax is payable on goods carriage under section 5(1)(a) in advance on or before the fifteenth day of January, April, July and October in each year. "
"Learned counsel urged that under section 9(3), in cases where breach occurs in payment of additional tax within the period specified under section 9(1), a penalty of twenty five per cent of the due amount has been prescribed for goods carriage plying under permits granted by authorities within UP, whereas a ten times penalty is imposed for the same offence on transport vehicles having national permit under section 10(3) as it was found that in the former case, the authorities within the State of UP had better control as compared to goods carriages registered outside the State of UP plying under the national permit under section 88(12) of the M.V. Act, 1988 and, therefore, there was no discrimination between the two categories as alleged. "
"8.  Learned counsel further contended that under section 10 of the 1997 Act, no transport vehicle under temporary permit granted under section 87 of the M.V. Act, 1988 or under national permit granted under section 88(12) of the M.V. Act, 1988 or under permit by section 88(9) of the said M.V. Act, 1988 can ply in U.P. without payment of tax at the specified rate for each of the three categories. "
"According to the learned counsel in the present case, we are concerned with section 10(1)(b) of the 1997 Act, as the offending vehicle was a transport vehicle under national permit granted under section 88(12) of the M.V. Act, 1988 by a authority in State of M.P. and, therefore, it was liable to pay additional tax under section 5 at the rate mentioned in clause 'B' of the third schedule to the 1997 Act. "
"9.  Learned counsel submitted that since the offending vehicle was found plying in the State of U.P. without payment of additional tax, it became liable to ten times penalty. "
"Learned counsel further pointed out that section 12 of the 1997 Act provides for refund and in cases where refund is refused, the aggrieved person is entitled to move the appellate authority and, therefore, determination and adjudication is also provided for in the Act. "
"Learned counsel, therefore, urged that the High Court had erred in striking down section 10(3) of the 1997 Act as oppressive, coercive and unreasonable and, therefore, violative of articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. "
"10.  On behalf of the respondent, it was urged that there was paucity of collection centres in UP and in most cases these centres were located 50 to 60 kms. "
"from the entry point and consequently, the drivers were required to carry demand drafts/cash to pay composite tax in these centres and in the process if apprehended, they are fined under section 10(3) of the Act. "
"It was further submitted that the imposition of ten times penalty in any event was harsh, unreasonable, unconscionable and confiscatory in nature. "
"In this connection, it was urged that on the composite tax of Rs.5100/-, ten times penalty would come to Rs.51000/-, which was unreasonable and, therefore, violative of article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. "
"It was urged that penalty up to ten times could have been imposed so that in genuine cases, the respondents could be made liable for lesser penalty in cases of mistakes in non payment of tax. "
"However, in the present case, under section 10(3), ten times penalty at a fixed rate on composite tax was harsh, arbitrary and unreasonable as no opportunity is provided to the alleged offending vehicle to explain its case and to get the penalty reduced. "
"It was urged that in imposition of ten times penalty, there was no adjudication and determination of the quantum. "
11.  It was urged that to impose ten times penalty without determination violated the rights of the respondent under articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. 
"It was next contended that the imposition of ten times penalty was discriminatory and irrational as for the same offence in respect of vehicles failing under section 9(3), penalty does not exceed twenty five per cent of the due amount, whereas transport vehicle plying in UP under national permit on default is liable to ten times penalty and, therefore, the said levy was unreasonable, irrational and discriminatory and consequently, violative of article 14 of the Constitution. "
"It was further urged that vehicles registered in UP had to pay Rs.550/ as composite tax and ten times penalty for such vehicles came to Rs.5500/ whereas transport vehicles plying under national permit have to pay composite tax of Rs.5100/ and on default, they are liable to penalty of Rs.51000/-, which according to the respondent was unreasonable, discriminatory and violative of their rights under article 14 of the Constitution. "
"12.  Before dealing with the aforestated contentions, we may analyse the provisions of the U.P. Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1997. "
The Act was enacted to provide for imposition of tax in the State on motor vehicles. 
The Act was also enacted to provide for imposition of additional tax on motor vehicles engaged in the transport of passengers and goods for hire. 
"Section 2(a) defines ""additional tax"" to mean a tax imposed under section 5 or section 6 in addition to the tax imposed under section 4. "
"Section 2(d) defines ""goods carriage"" to mean any motor vehicle constructed or adapted wholly or partly for use for the carriage of goods, or any motor vehicle not so constructed or adapted when actually used for the carriage of goods, and includes a trailer. "
"Section 2(h) defines ""owner"" in respect of a motor vehicle to mean the person whose name is entered in the certificate of registration issued in respect of such vehicle. "
"Section 2(n) defines ""transport vehicle"" to mean a goods carriage or a public service vehicle. "
"Section 4 imposes tax on motor vehicles other than transport vehicles used in any public place in U.P. Section 4(1) inter alia states that no motor vehicle, other than a transport vehicle, shall be used unless a one-time tax at the rate applicable and as specified in part 'B' of the first schedule is paid. "
"Section 4(2), inter alia, states that no transport vehicle shall be used in any public place in U.P. unless a tax at the rate prescribed in part 'D' of the first schedule has been paid. "
Section 5 deals with levy of additional tax on goods carriages. 
"It states, inter alia, that no goods carriage shall be operated in any public place in U.P., unless there has been paid, in addition to the tax payable under section 4, an additional tax at the rate applicable to goods carriage specified in the third schedule. "
The third schedule is again in two parts. 
"13.  In the case of goods carriage plying under permits granted by the State authorities, the tax payable is different from the goods carriage operated under national permits granted under section 88(12) of the 1988 Act. "
"In the latter case, additional tax is payable at the rate prescribed by part 'B' of the third schedule. "
"14.  Therefore, sections 5(1)(a) and 5(1)(b) show a dichotomy in the matter of levy of additional tax between goods carriages plying under permits granted by authorities within the State of U.P. and goods carriages plying under national permits. "
Section 9 deals with payment of tax and penalties. 
"Under section 9(1)(ii), the tax payable under section 4(2) is payable in advance for each quarter at the time of registration of the vehicle. "
"Under section 9(1)(iii), the additional tax payable under section 5(1)(a) is required to be paid in advance on or before the 15th day of January, April, July and October in each year. "
"Under section 9(3), it is stated, that, where the tax or additional tax in respect of a motor vehicle is not paid within the period specified in sub-section (1), a penalty at the rate not exceeding twenty five per cent of the due amount, shall be payable, for which the owner and the operator shall be jointly and severally liable. "
Section 10 deals with transport vehicles which ply in U.P. It begins with the non obstante clause. 
"15.  It states that notwithstanding anything contained in section 9, no transport vehicle shall ply in the State under a temporary permit granted under the 1988 Act unless the vehicle has paid a tax under section 4 calculated at the appropriate rate specified in the first schedule, as also additional tax under section 5 calculated at the appropriate rate specified in the sixth schedule. "
"Under section 10(1)(b), no transport vehicle shall ply in U.P. under a national permit granted under section 88(12) of the M.V. Act, 1988 by an authority having jurisdiction outside U.P. unless the vehicle has paid additional tax under section 5 at the rate specified in clause 'B' of the third schedule. "
16.  The main question in these civil appeals is whether section 10(3) inserted by Amending Act No.25 of 2001 imposing ten times penalty is void for infringement of respondent's rights under articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution as held by the impugned judgment. 
"Therefore, we are concerned with the validity of the said section which reads as follows: "
Vehicles not to be used in Uttar Pradesh without payment of tax. 
"(3) If such transport vehicle is found plying in Uttar Pradesh without payment of the tax or additional tax payable under this Act such tax or additional tax along with a penalty, equivalent to ten times of the due tax or additional tax shall be payable."" "
"17.  In the case of State of Madras v. V. G. Row reported in AIR 1952 SC 196 1952 Indlaw SC 33 at p. 200, this Court observed as follows:- "
"It is important in this context to bear in mind that the test of reasonableness, wherever prescribed, should be applied to each individual statute impugned, and no abstract standard, or general pattern of reasonableness can be laid down as applicable to all cases. 	Precedent
The nature of the right alleged to have been infringed, the underlying purpose of the restrictions imposed, the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby, the disproportion of the imposition, the prevailing conditions at the time, should all enter into the judicial verdict. "
"18.  In the case of Bhavesh D. Parish & Others v. Union of India & Another reported in (2000) 5 SCC 471 2000 Indlaw SC 625, this Court laid down that while considering the scope of economic legislation as well as tax legislation, the courts must bear in mind that unless the provision is manifestly unjust or glaringly unconstitutional, the courts must show judicial restraint in interfering with its applicability. "
"Merely because a statute comes up for examination and some arguable point is raised, the legislative will should not be put under a cloud. "
It is now well-settled that there is always a presumption in favour of the Constitutional validity of any legislation unless the same is set aside for breach of the provisions of the Constitution. 
The system of checks and balances has to be utilized in a balanced manner with the primary objective of accelerating economic growth rather than suspending its growth by doubting its constitutional efficacy at the threshold itself. 
"19.  In the case of R.K. Garg etc. v. Union of India & Others reported in (1981) 4 SCC 675 1981 Indlaw SC 372, this Court held that every legislation, particularly in economic matters, is essentially empiric and it is based on experimentation. "
There may be possibilities of abuse but on that account alone it cannot be struck down as invalid. 
These can be set right by the legislature by passing amendments. 
"The Court must, therefore, adjudge the Constitutionality of such legislation by the generality of its provisions. "
"Laws relating to economic activities should be viewed with greater latitude than laws touching civil rights such as freedom of speech, religion etc. "
"Moreover, there is a presumption in favour of the Constitutionality of a statute and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a clear transgression of the Constitutional principles. "
"The legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people, its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and its discrimination are based on adequate grounds. "
"There may be cases where the legislation can be condemned as arbitrary or irrational, hence, violative of article 14. "
But the test in every case would be whether the provisions of the Act are arbitrary and irrational having regard to all the facts and circumstances of the case. 
"Immorality, by itself, cannot be a constitutional challenge as morality is essentially a subjective value. "
"The terms ""reasonable, just and fair"" derive their significance from the existing social conditions. "
"20.  In the light of the above judgments as applicable to the provisions of the 1997 Act, we are of the view that the High Court had erred in striking down section 10(3) as ultra vires articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. "
Penalty is a slippery word and it has to be understood in the context in which it is used in a given statute. 
A penalty may be the subject-matter of a breach of statutory duty or it may be the subject-matter of a complaint. 
"In ordinary parlance, the proceedings may cover penalties for avoidance of civil liabilities which do not constitute offences against the State. "
This distinction is responsible for any enactment intended to protect public revenue. 
"21.  Thus, all penalties do not flow from an offence as is commonly understood but all offences lead to a penalty. "
"Whereas the former is a penalty which flows from a disregard of statutory provisions, the latter is entailed where there is mens rea and is made the subject-matter of adjudication. "
"In our view, penalty under section 10(3) of the Act is compensatory. "
It is levied for breach of a statutory duty for non-payment of tax under the Act. 
Section 10(3) is enacted to protect public revenue. 
It is enacted as a deterrent for tax evasion. 
"If the statutory dues of the State are paid, there is no question of imposition of heavy penalty. "
Everything which is incidental to the main purpose of a power is contained within the power itself. 
The power to impose penalty is for the purpose of vindicating the main power which is conferred by the statute in question. 
Deterrence is the main theme of object behind that imposition of penalty under section 10(3). 
"22.  In the case of State of Tamil Nadu v. M Krishnappan & Another reported in (2005) 4 SCC 53 2005 Indlaw SC 248, this Court has held that entry 57 of list II of the seventh schedule to the Constitution provides a field to the State legislature to impose tax in respect of every aspect of a vehicle. "
The State has to find funds for making new roads and for maintenance of existing roads. 
The Motor Vehicles Act is regulatory and compensatory in nature in the sense that it is imposed to meet the increasing costs of maintenance and upkeep and to that extent it is not plenary. 
"In the said judgment, it has been held that imposition of higher burden of tax on vehicles based on intelligible reasoning and differentia will not make the impugned levy discriminatory, arbitrary or unreasonable so as to violate article 14 of the Constitution. "
"23.  Lastly, we may point out that under section 12, the drivers/operators are entitled to claim refund of tax. "
"Similarly, under section 18, any person aggrieved by the order of the Tax Officer under section 12 is entitled to move the appellate authority within 30 days. "
Learned counsel for the State stated before us and we record her statement that cases of this type would come under section 18. 
"Learned counsel for the State also pointed out that in appropriate cases where the transport vehicle carries perishable goods, the vehicle is released on the driver depositing the relevant documents with the Tax Officer so that payment could be made within a stipulated period. "
"Although section 18 refer to appellate authority, in our view, on an examination of the scheme of the Act, we find from the provisions of section 18 that the authority deciding appeals against orders passed by Tax Officer under section 12 is really exercising initial jurisdiction and that under the Act, there are sufficient safeguards and conditions which are not onerous and which provide a forum for the aggrieved party to get redressal and, therefore, the High Court had erred in striking down section 10(3) of the Act. "
"24.  In the case of Rahimbhai Karimbhai Nagriwala v. B.B. Patel & Others reported in (1974) 97 ITR 660 1973 Indlaw GUJ 34, penalty under section 271(1)(c) of the IT Act, as it stood at the relevant time, was levied on the assessee at Rs.13,854/-, equal to 100 per cent of the alleged concealed income. "
The assessee challenged the Constitutional validity of section 271(1)(c) on the ground that the provision was violative of article 14 of the Constitution inasmuch there was no classification at all though there was a difference between various types of tax evasions. 
It was urged that such a severe penalty of concealment of income was confiscatory in nature. 
"It was urged that under section 271(1)(a)(i) of IT Act, the penalty for not filing a return was correlated to the amount of the tax evaded as against the correlation of penalty to concealed income under the impugned provisions of section 271(1)(c)(iii) was totally arbitrary because so far as concealed income was concerned, the penalty for concealed income proceeded on a different footing from penalty for omission to file a return in time. "
"It was also contended that the impugned penalty was disproportionate as there was no nexus between penalty imposed and the tax evaded and under the circumstances, it was urged that section 271(1)(c)(iii) was violative of articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. "
"25.  This challenge was rejected by the Gujarat High Court observing that everything which is incidental to the main purpose of a power is contained within the power itself so that it extends to matters which are necessary for the reasonable fulfilment of the legislative power over the subject matter and, therefore, the power to impose penalty is for the purpose of vindicating the main power, which is conferred by the Act. "
The object of the legislature in levying such penalty is to provide deterrent against tax evasion and to put a stop to a practice which the legislature considers to be against the public interest. 
"It has been further observed that while article 14 forbids class legislation, it does not forbid reasonable classification for the purposes of legislation. "
The Supreme Court has permitted a very wide latitude in classification for taxation. 
The object of the legislature in enacting the impugned provision is not to provide for confiscation but to provide a penalty for concealment of income and that too by providing a deterrent penalty. 
"26.  In our view, the judgment of the Gujarat High Court in the case of Rahimbhai Karimbhai Nagriwala 1973 Indlaw GUJ 34 (supra), is squarely applicable to the present case. "
"Deterrence is the main theme or object behind the imposition of penalty and, therefore, it is not possible to say that in the instant case the provision of section 10(3) infringes articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, as held in the impugned judgment. "
"27.  Accordingly, the appeals filed by the State succeed and are hereby allowed, the impugned judgment and order of the High Court is set aside, with no order as to costs. "
Appeal allowed 
"The Appellant in Criminal Appeal No.430 of 2014 was convicted for an offence under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as the 'IPC') and sentenced to life imprisonment. "
The Appeal preferred by him was dismissed by the High Court. 
The Appellants in Criminal Appeal Nos.458-459 of 2014 who were tried along with the Appellant in Crl. 
Appeal 430 of 2014 were acquitted by the Trial Court. 
Their acquittal was challenged by the State and the wife of the deceased before the High Court. 
The High Court reversed the acquittal and convicted them under Section 302 and sentenced them to life imprisonment. 
"Aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court, the Appellants have filed the above Appeals. "
An FIR was registered at 11:45 am on 11.01.2010 on the basis of statement given by Sadiq Hussain Majloom Jafri (PW-3). 
"As per the FIR, Sarfraj Akbar Syyed who was a resident of Jamkhed, District Ahmednagar was eking out his livelihood by selling goggles and spectacles. "
Sadiq Hussain Majloom Jafri (PW-3) along with his cousin Jafar Ali (PW-4) reached Ahmednagar at 10:00 am on 09.01.2010. 
They spent the whole day selling goggles at Ahmednagar and spent the night in a hotel. 
They continued their activity of selling goggles during the day time on 10.01.2010 also. 
"On the night of 10.01.2010, they were joined by their maternal uncle Sarfraj and all of them stayed at a lodge. "
"At 09:00 am PW-3, PW-4 and Sarfraj reached Chaudhari Dhaba at Nagar Manmad road, Tal. "
"Nagar, Ahmednagar. "
"They made an attempt to sell the goggles to the truck drivers at the dhaba, in vain. "
They sat on a cot in front of the dhaba and were having tea. 
The Appellants reached the dhaba and asked Sarfraj to step aside as they wanted to speak to him. 
Sarfraj went with the Appellants to the rear side of the dhaba. 
After some time PW-3 and PW-4 heard abuses and shouts from the back side of dhaba and they rushed to see what was happening. 
They saw Sigva Ali (A-4) and Javed Ali (A-3) catching hold of the hands of Sarfraj. 
Sikandar Ali (A-1) attacked Sarfraj with a knife on the left side of his neck. 
They also saw Shahajan Ali (A-2) abusing Sarfraj and assaulting him by giving him fist blows. 
PW-3 and PW-4 started shouting for help and caught hold of A-1 and A-2 not permitting them to escape. 
A-3 and A-4 ran away from the spot. 
PW-7 who was working at the dhaba also witnessed the incident. 
"On receipt of information, the police reached the place of occurrence within half an hour. "
A-1 and A-2 were taken into custody by the police. 
"PW-3 and PW-4 took Sarfraj to the Civil Hospital, Ahmednagar in an auto rickshaw. "
"At 11:30 am, the doctor examined Sarfraj and declared him dead. "
"Thereafter, PW-3 and PW-4 went to the MIDC Police Station and reported the incident. "
"The Post-mortem was conducted by Dr. Sandhya Deorao Chavan (PW 8) at the Civil Hospital, Ahmednagar at 2.30 pm. "
The external injury found on the dead body was described as follows in the post-mortem certificate issued by PW 8 :- 
"1/- Deep incised wound on left side of neck at corotidregion, horizontal, slightly curved laterally 3 length, 1"" in breadth and 2.1/2"" in depth. "
Deeper on lateral aspect than medical aspect. 
Edges are well defined clean and everted and deeply stained. 
"Sprouting of blood seen on left side of chest, shoulder and back. "
"Carotid vessel torn and retracted on left side."" "
The cause of death was haemorrhage shock due to rupture of right carotid vessel. 
Charge-sheet was filed against all the four accused and thereafter charges were framed for an offence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC. 
The Trial Court convicted the Appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 430 of 2014 for an offence punishable under Section 302 and sentenced him to life imprisonment. 
The other accused who are Appellants in Criminal Appeal Nos. 458-459 of 2014 were acquitted by the Trial Court. 
"As stated earlier, the conviction and sentence of the Appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 430 of 2014 was confirmed by the High Court. "
The acquittal of the Appellants in Criminal Appeal Nos. 
458-459 of 2014 was reversed by the High Court and they were convicted under Section 302 IPC and sentenced to life imprisonment. 
The deceased Sarfraj was having a shop at Jamkhed where he was selling goggles. 
He was the maternal uncle of PW-3 who is also in the same business. 
PW-3 was being helped by the deceased for selling goggles in the Ahmednagar area. 
The case of the prosecution is that there was rivalry between the accused and the deceased as they were in the same business. 
"PW-3, PW-4 and PW-7 deposed that at 10:00 am the deceased, PW-3 and PW-4 reached Chaudhari dhaba at Nagar Manmad road and were having tea. "
All the accused reached the dhaba and took the deceased behind the dhaba saying that they wanted to speak to him. 
There is evidence on record to show that the deceased was attacked by Sikandar Ali (A-1) with a knife and the other accused assisted him in the attack. 
Sikardar Ali (A-1) and Shahjahan Ali (A-2) were caught and handed over to the police at the spot. 
"Though PW-3 and PW-4 were related to the deceased, their evidence is credible and trustworthy. "
The oral testimony of PW-7 who was working at the dhaba is consistent with the version of PW-3 and PW-4. 
The medical evidence of PW-8 corroborates the oral testimonies. 
We are in agreement with the findings recorded by the Trial Court that the death of Sarfraj is homicidal in nature. 
We also do not find fault with the finding recorded by the Trial Court that the death of Sarfraj was caused due to the injury caused by Sikandar Ali (A-1). 
We find no fault with the judgment of the High Court in confirming the findings of the Trial Court that Sikandar Ali is guilty of causing the death of Sarfraj. 
The Trial Court acquitted accused 2 to 4 on the ground that the only role that was attributed to them by PW-3 and PW-4 was that they caught hold of the hands of the deceased during the attack. 
The Trial Court further held that though the presence of the Appellants in Crl. 
Appeal Nos.458-459 of 2014 was proved there was no evidence to prove the common intention of these accused along with A-1. 
The Trial Court also held that there was no evidence to show that the attack was pre-meditated. 
"In the appeals against acquittal, the High Court held that there was a common intention on the part of A-1 to A-4 to eliminate Sarfraj. "
"The High Court further held that A-2 to A-4 assisted A-1 to cause injury to the deceased, and, thus, were liable to be punished for the homicide. "
"On the basis of the said findings, the High Court convicted A-2 to A-4 under Section 302 IPC and sentenced them to life imprisonment.. "
We have no doubt about the complicity of all the accused in the homicide of Sarfraj. 
A-1 attacked the deceased with the knife and caused injury on his neck which resulted in his death. 
The other accused assisted him in committing the crime by holding the hands of the deceased. 
"However, the only question that falls for our consideration is whether the accused are liable to be punished for an offence under Section 302 IPC. "
"After considering the submissions made by the counsel for the Appellants and scrutinising the material on record, we are of the opinion that the accused are not liable to be convicted under Section 302 IPC. "
We are convinced that there was neither prior concert nor common intention to commit a murder. 
During the course of their business activity the accused reached the dhaba where the deceased was present. 
An altercation took place during the discussion they were having behind the dhaba. 
That led to a sudden fight during which A-1 attacked the deceased with a knife. 
Exception 4 to Section 300 is applicable to the facts of this case. 
"As we are convinced that the accused are responsible for the death of Sarfraj, we are of the opinion that they are liable for conviction under Section 304 part II of the IPC. "
We are informed that A-1 has undergone a sentence of seven years and that A-2 to A-4 have undergone four years of imprisonment. 
We modify the judgment of the High Court converting the conviction of the accused from Section 302 to Section 304 part II of the IPC sentencing them to the period already undergone. 
They shall be released forthwith. 
The Appeals are disposed of accordingly. 
Appeals disposed of 
BACKGROUND FACTS 
1.  One Thippaiah was the owner of 5 acre 23 guntas of land having been recorded in Survey No. 153/1 of Chikkabanavara Village. 
"Nanjapa, adoptive father of Respondent No. 1 purchased a portion thereof measuring 1 acre 21 guntas on 11.09.1933. "
"By reason of two different sale deeds, dated 11.04.1934 and 5.07.1936, the appellants herein purchased 2 acre 15 guntas and 3 acre 8 guntas of land respectively, out of the said plot. "
"Despite the fact that Nanjapa purchased a portion of the said plot, the appellants allegedly took over possession of the entire 5 acre 23 guntas of land after the aforementioned purchases. "
"However, when allegedly their possession was sought to be disturbed by the respondent in the year 1988, they filed a suit in the court of Additional City Civil Judge, Bangalore which was marked as O.S. No. 287 of 1989. "
"In the said suit, they clamed title on the basis of adverse possession stating: "
"The plaintiffs submit that in any event the plaintiffs have perfected their title by adverse possession as the plaintiffs have been in open, continuous uninterrupted and hostile possession of the plaint schedule land, adversely to the interest of any other person including the defendant for the past over fifty years exercising absolute rights of ownership in respect of the plaint schedule land  "
"2.  Defendants Respondents in their written statement denied and disputed the aforementioned assertion of the plaintiffs and pleaded their own right, title and interest as also possession in or over the said 1 acre 21 guntas of land. "
The learned Trial Judge decreed the suit inter alia holding that the plaintiffs appellants have acquired title by adverse possession as they have been in possession of the lands in question for a period of more than 50 years. 
"On an appeal having been preferred there against by the respondents before the High Court, the said judgment of the Trial Court was reversed holding: "
"(i) ""The important averments of adverse possession are two fold. "
One is to recognize the title of the person against whom adverse possession is claimed. 
Another is to enjoy the property adverse to the title holder's interest after making him known that such enjoyment is against his own interest. 
"These two averments are basically absent in this case both in the pleadings as well as in the evidence "" "
"(ii) ""The finding of the Court below that the possession of the plaintiffs' become adverse to the defendants between 1934-1936 is again an error apparent on the face of the record. "
As it is now clarified before me by the learned counsel for the appellants that the plaintiffs' claim in respect of the other land of the defendants is based on the subsequent sale deed dated 5.7.1936. 
It is settled law that mere possession even if it is true for any number of years will not cloth the person in enjoyment with the title by adverse possession. 
"As indicated the important ingredients of adverse possession should have been satisfied."" "
"3.  Mr. P. Krishnamoorthy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants, submitted that the High Court committed a manifest error in arriving at the aforementioned conclusion as it failed to take into consideration the principle that acknowledgement of the owner's title was not sine qua non for claiming title by prescription. "
Reliance in this behalf has been placed on Secy. 
of State v. Debendra Lal Khan [AIR 1934 PC 23] . 
and State of West Bengal v. The Dalhousie Institute Society [AIR 1970 SC 1798 1970 Indlaw SC 481]. 
"The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents, on the other hand, supported the impugned judgment. "
CHARACTERIZING ADVERSE POSSESSION 
4.  Adverse possession in one sense is based on the theory or presumption that the owner has abandoned the property to the adverse possessoror on the acquiescence of the owner to the hostile acts and claims of the person in possession. 
"It follows that sound qualities of a typical adverse possession lie in it being open, continuous and hostile. "
Efficacy of adverse possession law in most jurisdictions depend on strong limitation statutes by operation of which right to access the court expires through effluxion of time. 
"As against rights of the paper-owner, in the context of adverse possession, there evolves a set of competing rights in favour of the adverse possessor who has, for a long period of time, cared for the land, developed it, as against the owner of the property who has ignored the property. "
"Modern statutes of limitation operate, as a rule, not only to cut off one's right to bring an action for the recovery of property that has been in the adverse possession of another for a specified time, but also to vest the possessor with title. "
"The intention of such statutes is not to punish one who neglects to assert rights, but to protect those who have maintained the possession of property for the time specified by the statute under claim of right or colour of title. "
"(See American Jurisprudence, Vol. 3, 2d, Page 81). "
"It is important to keep in mind while studying the American notion of Adverse Possession, especially in the backdrop of Limitation Statutes, that the intention to dispossess cannot be given a complete go by. "
Simple application of Limitation shall not be enough by itself for the success of an adverse possession claim. 
6.  To understand the true nature of adverse possession can be considered where House of Lords referring to termed adverse possession as a negative and consequential right effected only because somebody else's positive right to access the court is barred by operation of law: 
"In my opinion this principle has been settled law since the date of that decision. 	Precedent
It formed the basis of the later decision of the Divisional Count in Taylor v. Twinberrow [1930] 2 K.B. 16 in which it was most clearly explained by Scrutton, L.J. that it was a misunderstanding of the legal effect of 12 years adverse possession under the Limitation Act to treat it as if it gave a title whereas its effect is  merely negative "" and, where the possession had been against a tenant, its only operation was to bar his right to claim against the man in possession . "
I think that this statement needs only one qualification: a squatter does in the end get a title by his possession and the indirect operation of the Act and he can convey a fee simple. 
"If this principle is applied, as it must be, to the Appellant's situation, it appears that the adverse possession completed in 1932 against the lessee of No. 315 did not transfer to him either the lessee's' term or his rights against or has obligations to the landlord who held the reversion. "
"The appellant claims to be entitled to keep the landlord at bay until the expiration of the term by effluxion of time in 1992: but, if he is, it cannot be because he is the transferee or holder of the term which was granted to the lessee. "
"He is in possession by his own right, so far as it is a right: and it is a right so far as the statutes of limitation which govern the matter prescribe both when the rights to dispossess him are to be treated as accruing and when, having accrued, they are thereafter to be treated as barred. "
"In other words, a squatter has as much protection as but no more protection than the statutes allow: but he has not the title or estate of the owner or owners whom he has dispossessed nor has he in any relevant sense an estate ""commensurate with"" the estate of the dispossessed. "
"All that this misleading phrase can mean is that, since his possession only defeats the rights of those to whom it has been adverse, there may be rights not prescribed against, such, for instance, as equitable easements, which axe no less enforceable against him in respect of the land than they would have been against the owners he has dispossessed."" "
7.  Also see Privy Council's decision in Chung Ping Kwan and Others v. Lam Island Development Company Limited (Hong Kong) [(1997) AC 38] . 
in this regard. 
"Therefore, to assess a claim of adverse possession, two-pronged enquiry is required: "
"Application of limitation provision thereby jurisprudentially ""willful neglect"" element on part of the owner established. "
Successful application in this regard distances the title of the land from the paper-owner. 
"Specific Positive intention to dispossess on the part of the adverse possessor effectively shifts the title already distanced from the paper owner, to the adverse possessor. "
"Right thereby accrues in favour of adverse possessor as intent to dispossess is an express statement of urgency and intention in the upkeep of the property."" "
8.  It is interesting to see the development of adverse possession law in the backdrop of the status of Right to Property in the 21st Century. 
"The aspect of stronger Property Rights Regime in general, coupled with efficient legal regimes furthering the Rule of Law argument, has redefined the thresholds in adverse possession law not just in India but also by the Strasbourg Court. "
Growth of Human Rights jurisprudence in recent times has also palpably affected the developments in this regard. 
NEW CONSIDERATION IN ADVERSE POSSESSION LAW 
"9.  In that context it is relevant to refer to JA Pye (Oxford) Ltd v. United Kingdom [2005] 49 ERG 90, [2005] ECHR 921 wherein the European Court of Human Rights while referring to the Court of Appeal judgment ([2001]EWCA Civ 117, [2001] Ch 804) made the following reference: "
"Lord Justice Keene took as his starting point that limitation periods were in principle not incompatible with the Convention and that the process whereby a person would be barred from enforcing rights by the passage of time was clearly acknowledged by the Convention (Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms). 	Precedent
This position obtained, in his view, even though limitation periods both limited the right of access to the courts and in some circumstances had the effect of depriving persons of property rights, whether real or personal, or of damages: there was thus nothing inherently incompatible as betweenthe 1980 Act and article 1 of the Protocol. "
10.  This brings us to the issue of mental element in adverse possession cases-intention. 
Positive Intention 
The aspect of positive intention is weakened in this case by the sale deeds dated 11.04.1934 and 5.07.1936. 
Intention is a mental element which is proved and disproved through positive acts. 
"Existence of some events can go a long way to weaken the presumption of intention to dispossess which might have painstakingly grown out of long possession which otherwise would have sufficed in a standard adverse possession case.. The fact of possession is important in more than one ways: firstly, due compliance on this count attracts Limitation act  and it also assists the court to unearth as the intention to dispossess. "
"12.  At this juncture, it would be in the fitness of circumstances to discuss intention to dispossess vis-'-vis intention to possess. "
This distinction can be marked very distinctively in the present circumstances. 
"Importantly, intention to possess can not be substituted for intention to dispossess which is essential to prove adverse possession. "
The factum of possession in the instant case only goes on to objectively indicate intention to possess the land. 
"As also has been noted by the High Court, if the appellant has purchased the land without the knowledge of earlier sale, then in that case the intention element is not of the variety and degree which is required for adverse possession to materialize. "
The High Court observed: 
"It is seen from the pleadings as well in evidence that the plaintiff came to know about the right of the defendants', only when disturbances were sought to be made to his possession. "
"13.  In similar circumstances, in the case of Thakur Kishan Singh (dead) v. Arvind Kumar [(1994) 6 SCC 591 1994 Indlaw SC 818]. "
this court held: 
"As regards adverse possession, it was not disputed even by the trial court that the appellant entered into possession over the land in dispute under a licence from the respondent for purposes of brick-kiln. 	Precedent
The possession thus initially being permissive, the burden was heavy on the appellant to establish that it became adverse. 	Precedent
A possession of a co-owner or of a licencee or of an agent or a permissive possession to become adverse must be established by cogent and convincing evidence to show hostile animus and possession adverse to the knowledge of real owner. 	Precedent
Mere possession for howsoever length of time does not result in converting the permissible possession into adverse possession. 	Precedent
Apart from it, the Appellate Court has gone into detail and after considering the evidence on record found it as a fact that the possession of the appellant was not adverse. "
14.  The present case is one of the few ones where even an unusually long undisturbed possession does not go on to prove the intention of the adverse possessor. 
"This is a rare circumstance, which Clarke LJ in Lambeth London Borough Council v Blackburn (2001) 82 PCR 494, 504 refers to: "
"I would not for my part think it appropriate to strain to hold that a trespasser who had established factual possession of the property for the necessary 12 years did not have the animus possidendi identified in the cases. 	Precedent
I express that view for two reasons. 	Precedent
The first is that the requirement that there be a sufficient manifestation of the intention provides protection for landowners and the second is that once it is held that the trespasser has factual possession it will very often be the case that he can establish the manifested intention. 	Precedent
Indeed it is difficult to find a case in which there has been a clear finding of factual possession in which the claim to adverse possession has failed for lack of intention. "
"15.  On intention is quite illustrative and categorical, holding in the following terms: "
"If the law is to attribute possession of land to a person who can establish no paper title to possession, he must be shown to have both factual possession and the requisite intention to possess ('animus possidendi'). "
"16.  If his acts are open to more than one interpretation and he has not made it perfectly plain to the world at large by his actions or words that he has intended to exclude the owner as best he can, the courts will treat him as not having had the requisite animus possidendi and consequently as not having dispossessed the owner. "
"In my judgment it is consistent with principle as well as authority that a person who originally entered another's land as a trespasser, but later seeks to show that he has dispossessed the owner, should be required to adduce compelling evidence that he had the requisite animus possidendi in any case where his use of the land was equivocal, in the sense that it did not necessarily, by itself, betoken an intention on his part to claim the land as his own and exclude the true owner. "
"What is really meant, in my judgment, is that the animus possidendi involves the intention, in one's own name and on one's own behalf, to exclude the world at large, including the owner with the paper title if he be not himself the possessor, so far as is reasonably practicable and so far as the processes of the law will allow."" "
"19.  Thus, there must be intention to dispossess. "
And it needs to be open and hostile enough to bring the same to the knowledge and plaintiff has an opportunity to object. 
After all adverse possession right is not a substantive right but a result of the waiving (willful) or omission (negligent or otherwise) of right to defend or care for the integrity of property on the part of the paper owner of the land. 
"Adverse possession statutes, like other statutes of limitation, rest on a public policy that do not promote litigation and aims at the repose of conditions that the parties have suffered to remain unquestioned long enough to indicate their acquiescence. "
"20.  While dealing with the aspect of intention in the Adverse possession law, it is important to understand its nuances from varied angles. "
Intention implies knowledge on the part of adverse possessor. 
"The case of Saroop Singh v. Banto and Others [(2005) 8 SCC 330] 2005 Indlaw SC 610, 504 in that context held: "
In terms of article 65 the starting point of limitation does not commence from the date when the right of ownership arises to the plaintiff but commences from the date the defendants possession becomes adverse. 
(See Vasantiben Prahladji Nayak v. Somnath Muljibhai Nayak 2004 Indlaw SC 1448). 
Animus possidendi is one of the ingredients of adverse possession. 
Unless the person possessing the land has a requisite animus the period for prescription does not commence. 
"As in the instant case, the appellant categorically states that his possession is not adverse as that of true owner, the logical corollary is that he did not have the requisite animus. "
"(See Mohd. Mohd. Ali v. Jagadish Kalita 2003 Indlaw SC 820.)"" "
"22.  A peaceful, open and continuous possession as engraved in the maxim nec vi, nec clam, nec precario has been noticed by this Court in Karnataka Board of Wakf v. Government of India and Others [(2004) 10 SCC 779 2004 Indlaw SC 295] in the following terms: "
"Physical fact of exclusive possession and the animus possidendi to hold as owner in exclusion to the actual owner are the most important factors that are to be accounted in cases of this nature. 	Precedent
Plea of adverse possession is not a pure question of law but a blended one of fact and law. 	Precedent
Therefore, a person who claims adverse possession should show: ( a) on what date he came into possession, (b) what was the nature of his possession, (c) whether the factum of possession was known to the other party, (d) how long his possession has continued, and ( e) his possession was open and undisturbed. 	Precedent
A person pleading adverse possession has no equities in his favour. 	Precedent
Since he is trying to defeat the rights of the true owner, it is for him to clearly plead and establish all facts necessary to establish his adverse possession  "
23.  It is important to appreciate the question of intention as it would have appeared to the paper-owner. 
The issue is that intention of the adverse user gets communicated to the paper owner of the property. 
This is where the law gives importance to hostility and openness as pertinent qualities of manner of possession. 
It follows that the possession of the adverse possessor must be hostile enough to give rise to a reasonable notice and opportunity to the paper owner. 
"24.  In Narne Rama Murthy v. Ravula Somasundaram and Others [(2005) 6 SCC 614 2005 Indlaw SC 470], this Court held: "
"However, in cases where the question of limitation is a mixed question of fact and law and the suit does not appear to be barred by limitation on the face of it, then the facts necessary to prove limitation must be pleaded, an issue raised and then proved. 	Precedent
In this case the question of limitation is intricately linked with the question whether the agreement to sell was entered into on behalf of all and whether possession was on behalf of all. 	Precedent
It is also linked with the plea of adverse possession. 	Precedent
Once on facts it has been found that the purchase was on behalf of all and that the possession was on behalf of all, then, in the absence of any open, hostile and overt act, there can be no adverse possession and the suit would also not be barred by limitation. 	Precedent
The only hostile act which could be shown was the advertisement issued in 1989. 	Precedent
The suit filed almost immediately thereafter. "
"25.  The test is, as has been held in the case of R. v. Oxfordshire County Council and Others, Ex Parte Sunning well Parish Council [1999] 3 ALL ER 385; [1999] 3 WLR 160:Bright v. Walker (1834) 1 Cr. "

" The presumption arises, as Fry J. said of prescription generally in Dalton v. Angus (1881) 6 App. 	Precedent
740, 773, from acquiescence. 	Precedent
26.  The case concerned interpretation of section 22(1) of the Commons Registration Act 1965. 	Precedent
section 22(1) defined town or village green"" as including, "
land on which the inhabitants of any locality have indulged in [lawful] sports and pastimes as of right for not less than 20 years. 
"27.  It was observed that the inhabitants' use of the land for sports and pastimes did not constitute the use ""as of right"". "
The belief that they had the right to do so was found to be lacking. 
The House held that they did not have to have a personal belief in their right to use the land. 
The court observed: 
"the words 'as of right' import the absence of any of the three characteristics of compulsion, secrecy or licence 'nec vi, nec clam, nec precario', phraseology borrowed from the law of easements. "
"28.  Later in the case of Beresford, R (on the application of) v. City of Sunderland [2003] 3 WLR 1306, [2004] 1 All ER 160 : [2004] 1 A.C. 889 same test was referred to. "
"Thus the test of nec vi, nec clam, nec precario i.e., ""not by force, nor stealth, nor the license of the owner"" has been an established notion in law relating to the whole range of similarly situated concepts such as easement, prescription, public dedication, limitation and adverse possession. "
"In Karnataka Wakf Board 2004 Indlaw SC 295 (Supra), the law was stated, thus: "
"In the eye of law, an owner would be deemed to be in possession of a property so long as there is no intrusion. 	Precedent
Non-use of the property by the owner even for a long time won't affect his title. 	Precedent
But the position will be altered when another person takes possession of the property and asserts a right over it. 	Precedent
Adverse possession is a hostile possession by clearly asserting hostile title in denial of the title of true owner. 	Precedent
It is a well- settled principle that a party claiming adverse possession must prove that his possession is 'nec vi, nec clam, nec precario', that is, peaceful, open and continuous. 	Precedent
The possession must be adequate in continuity, in publicity and in extent to show that their possession is adverse to the true owner. 	Precedent
It must start with a wrongful disposition of the rightful owner and be actual, visible, exclusive, hostile and continued over the statutory period. 	Precedent
(See : S M Karim v. Bibi Sakinal AIR 1964 SC 1254 1964 Indlaw SC 466, Parsinni v. Sukhi ( 1993 ) 4 SCC 375 1993 Indlaw SC 621 and D N Venkatarayappa v. State of Karnataka (1997) 7 SCC 567 1997 Indlaw SC 3062). 	Precedent
Physical fact of exclusive possession and the animus possidendi to hold as owner in exclusion to the actual owner are the most important factors that are to be accounted in cases of this nature. 	Precedent
Plea of adverse possession is not a pure question of law but a blended one of fact and law. 	Precedent
Therefore, a person who claims adverse possession should show (a) on what date he came into possession, (b) what was the nature of his possession, (c) whether the factum of possession was known to the other party, (d) how long his possession has continued, and (e) his possession was open and undisturbed. 	Precedent
A person pleading adverse possession has no equities in his favour. 	Precedent
Since he is trying to defeat the rights of true owner, it is for him to clearly plead and establish all facts necessary to establish his adverse possession. "
29.  Inquiry into the particulars of Adverse Possession Inquiry into the starting point of adverse possession i.e. dates as to when the paper owner got dispossessed is an important aspect to be considered. 
"In the instant case the starting point of adverse possession and Other facts such as the manner in which the possession operationalized, nature of possession: whether open, continuous, uninterrupted or hostile possession - have not been disclosed. "
An observation has been made in this regard in S.M. Karim v. Mst. 
Bibi Sakina [AIR 1964 SC 1254 1964 Indlaw SC 466]. 
"Adverse possession must be adequate in continuity, in publicity and extent and a plea is required at the least to show when possession becomes adverse so that the starting point of limitation against the party affected can be found. 	Precedent
There is no evidence here when possession became adverse, if it at all did, and a mere suggestion in the relief clause that there was an uninterrupted possession for several 12 years"" or that the plaintiff had acquired ""an absolute title"" was not enough to raise such a plea. "
"Long possession is not necessarily adverse possession and the prayer clause is not a substitute for a plea."" "
30.  Also mention as to the real owner of the property must be specifically made in an adverse possession claim. 
"In Karnataka Wakf Board 2004 Indlaw SC 295 (Supra), it is stated: "
"Plaintiff, filing a title suit should be very clear about the origin of title over the property. 	Precedent
He must specifically plead it. 	Precedent
In P Periasami v. P Periathambi ( 1995 ) 6 SCC 523 1995 Indlaw SC 1857 this Court ruled that -Whenever the plea of adverse possession is projected, inherent in the plea is that someone else was the owner of the property."" The pleas on title and adverse possession are mutually inconsistent and the latter does not begin to operate until the former is renounced. "
"Dealing with Mohan Lal v. Mirza Abdul Gaffar ( 1996 ) 1 SCC 639 1995 Indlaw SC 1899 that is similar to the case in hand, this Court held: "
"As regards the first plea, it is inconsistent with the second plea. 	Precedent
Having come into possession under the agreement, he must disclaim his right there under and plead and prove assertion of his independent hostile adverse possession to the knowledge of the transferor or his successor in title or interest and that the latter had acquiesced to his illegal possession during the entire period of 12 years, i.e., up to completing the period his title by prescription nec vi, nec clam, nec precario. 	Precedent
Since the appellant's claim is founded on Section 53-A, it goes without saying that he admits by implication that he came into possession of land lawfully under the agreement and continued to remain in possession till date of the suit. 	Precedent
Thereby the plea of adverse possession is not available to the appellant. "
31.  New Paradigm to Limitation Act The law in this behalf has undergone a change. 
"In terms of articles 142 and 144 of the Limitation Act, 1908, the burden of proof was on the plaintiff to show within 12 years from the date of institution of the suit that he had title and possession of the land, whereas in terms of articles 64 and 65 of the Limitation Act, 1963, the legal position has underwent complete change insofar as the onus is concerned: once a party proves its title, the onus of proof would be on the other party to prove claims of title by adverse possession. "
The ingredients of adverse possession have succinctly been stated by this Court in S.M. Karim v. Mst. 
Bibi Sakina [AIR 1964 SC 1254] in the following terms: 
"Adverse possession must be adequate in continuity, in publicity and extent and a plea is required at the least to show when possession becomes adverse so that the starting point of limitation against the party affected can be found  "
[See also M. Durai v. Madhu and Others 2007 (2) SCALE 309]2007 Indlaw SC 659]. 
32.  The aforementioned principle has been reiterated by this Court in Saroop Singh v. Banto and Others [(2005) 8 SCC 330 2005 Indlaw SC 610] stating: 
Animus possidendi is one of the ingredients of adverse possession. 
Unless the person possessing the land has a requisite animus the period for prescription does not commence. 
"As in the instant case, the appellant categorically states that his possession is not adverse as that of true owner, the logical corollary is that he did not have the requisite animus. "
"(See Mohd. Mohd. Ali v. Jagadish Kalita 2003 Indlaw SC 820)"" "
"33.  In Mohammadbhai Kasambhai Sheikh and Others v. Abdulla Kasambhai Sheikh [(2004) 13 SCC 385 2004 Indlaw SC 1934], this Court held: "
"But as has been held in Mahomedally Tyebally v. Safiabai the heirs of Mohammedans (which the parties before us are) succeed to the estate in specific shares as tenants-in-common and a suit by an heir for his/her share was governed, as regards immovable property, by article 144 of the Limitation Act, 1908. 	Precedent
article 144 of the Limitation Act, 1908 has been materially re-enacted as article 65 of the Limitation Act, 1963 and provides that the suit for possession of immovable property or any interest therein based on title must be filed within a period of 12 years from the date when the possession of the defendant becomes adverse to the plaintiff. 	Precedent
Therefore, unless the defendant raises the defence of adverse possession to a claim for a share by an heir to ancestral property, he cannot also raise an issue relating to the limitation of the plaintiffs claim  "
"34.  The question has been considered at some length recently in T. Anjanappa and Others v. Somalingappa and Another [(2006) 7 SCC 570 2006 Indlaw SC 927], wherein it was opined : "
"The High Court has erred in holding that even if the defendants claim adverse possession, they do not have to prove who is the true owner and even if they had believed that the Government was the true owner and not the plaintiffs, the same was inconsequential. 	Precedent
Obviously, the requirements of proving adverse possession have not been established. 	Precedent
If the defendants are not sure who is the true owner the question of their being in hostile possession and the question of denying title of the true owner do not arise. 	Precedent
Above being the position the High Court's judgment is clearly unsustainable  "
[See also Des Raj and Ors. v. Bhagat Ram (Dead) By LRs. 
"and Ors., 2007 (3) SCALE 371 2007 Indlaw SC 175; Govindammal v. R. Perumal Chettiar Ors., JT 2006 (10) SC 121 : (2006) 11 SCC 600 2006 Indlaw SC 710]. "
CONTENTIONS OF PARTIES 
"35.  The decision of the Judicial Committee in Debendra Lal Khan (supra), whereupon reliance has been placed by Mr. Krishnamoorthy, does not militate against the aforementioned propositions of law. "
The question which arose for consideration therein was as to whether the plaintiff had acquired right or title to the fisheries by adverse possession in the portion of river Cossye. 
"In the aforementioned situation, it was held that the Limitation Act is indulgent to the Crown in one respect only, namely, in requiring a much longer period of adverse possession than in the case of a subject; otherwise there is no discrimination between the Crown and the subject as regards the requisites of adverse possession. "
The said decision is not of much assistance in this case. 
"36.  In The Dalhousie Institute Society 1970 Indlaw SC 481 (supra), this Court found as of fact that the respondents were in open, continuous and uninterrupted possession and enjoyment of site for over 60 years. "
"It was in that situation, the title of the defendant, in that behalf, was accepted. "
RIGHT TO PROPERTY AS HUMAN RIGHT 
"37.  There is another aspect of the matter, which cannot be lost sight of. "
The right of property is now considered to be not only a constitutional or statutory right but also a human right. 
"Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, 1789 enunciates right to property article 17 : "
"since the right to property is inviolable and sacred, no-one may be deprived thereof, unless public necessity, legally ascertained, obviously requires it and just and prior indemnity has been paid. "
"Moreover, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 section 17(i) and 17(ii) also recognizes right to property: "
"17 (i) Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in association with others. 	Statute
(ii) No-one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property. "
"40.  Human rights have been historically considered in the realm of individual rights such as, right to health, right to livelihood, right to shelter and employment etc. "
but now human rights are gaining a multifaceted dimension. 
Right to property is also considered very much a part of the new dimension. 
"Therefore, even claim of adverse possession has to be read in that context. "
"The activist approach of the English Courts is quite visible from the judgement of Beaulane Properties Ltd. v. Palmer [2005 (3) WLR 554 : 2005 EWHC 817 (Ch.)] and JA Pye (Oxford) Ltd v. United Kingdom [2005] ECHR 921 [2005] 49 ERG 90, [2005] ECHR 921], The court herein tried to read the Human Rights position in the context of adverse possession. "
But what is commendable is that the dimensions of human rights has widened so much that now property dispute issues are also being raised within the contours of human rights. 
"41.  With the expanding jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, the Court has taken an unkind view to the concept of adverse possession in the recent judgment of J.A. Pye (Oxford) Ltd v. the United Kingdom [2005] ECHR 921 , which concerned the loss of ownership of land by virtue of adverse possession. "
42.  In the instant case the applicant company was the registered owner of a plot of 23 hectares of agricultural land. 
"The owners of a property adjacent to the land, Mr. and Mrs. Graham (""the Grahams"") occupied the land under a grazing agreement. "
After a brief exchange of documents in December 1983 a chartered surveyor acting for the applicants wrote to the Grahams noting that the grazing agreement was about to expire and requiring them to vacate the land. 
"43.  In essence, from September 1984 onwards until 1999 the Grahams continued to use the whole of the disputed land for farming without the permission of the applicants. "
"44.  In 1997, Mr Graham moved the Local Land Registry against the applicant on the ground that he had obtained title by adverse possession. "
The applicant companies responded to the motion and importantly also issued further proceedings seeking possession of the disputed land. 
"45.  The Grahams challenged the applicant companies' claims under theLimitation Act, 1980 (""the 1980 Act"") which provides that a person cannot bring an action to recover any land after the expiration of 12 years of adverse possession by another. "
"They also relied on the Land Registration Act, 1925, which applied at the relevant time and which provided that, after the expiry of the 12-year period, the registered proprietor was deemed to hold the land in trust for the squatter. "
46.  It is important to quote here the judgment pronounced in favour of the Grahams ([2000]Ch 676) . 
The court held in favour of the Grahams but went on to observe the irony in law of adverse possession. 
"According to the court, law which provides to oust an owner on the basis of inaction of 12 years is ""illogical and disproportionate"". "
"The effect of such law would ""seem draconian to the owner"" and ""a windfall for the squatter"". "
"The fact that just because ""the owner had taken no step to evict a squatter for 12 years, the owner should lose 25 hectares of land to the squatter with no compensation whatsoever"" would be disproportionate. "
47.  The applicant companies appealed and the Court of Appeal reversed the High Court decision. 
"The Grahams then appealed to the House of Lords, which, allowed their appeal and restored the order of the High Court. "
"In J A Pye (Oxford) Ltd Ors v Graham Anor [2002] 3 All ER 865 : [2003] 1 A.C. 419 House of Lords observed that the Grahams had possession of the land in the ordinary sense of the word, and therefore the applicant companies had been dispossessed of it within the meaning of the 1980 Act. "
There was no inconsistency between a squatter being willing to pay the paper owner if asked and his being in possession in the meantime. 
It will be pertinent to note in this regard Lord Bingham (agreeing with Lord Browne-Wilkinson) in the course of his judgment: 
"[The Grahams] sought rights to graze or cut grass on the land after the summer of 1984, and were quite prepared to pay. 	Precedent
When Pye failed to respond they did what any other farmer in their position would have done: they continued to farm the land. 	Precedent
They were not at fault. 	Precedent
But the result of Pye's inaction was that they enjoyed the full use of the land without payment for 12 years. 	Precedent
As if that were not gain enough, they are then rewarded by obtaining title to this considerable area of valuable land without any obligation to compensate the former owner in any way at all. 	Precedent
In the case of unregistered land, and in the days before registration became the norm, such a result could no doubt be justified as avoiding protracted uncertainty where the title to land lay. 	Precedent
But where land is registered it is difficult to see any justification for a legal rule which compels such an apparently unjust result, and even harder to see why the party gaining title should not be required to pay some compensation at least to the party losing it. 	Precedent
It is reassuring to learn that the Land Registration Act, 2002 has addressed the risk that a registered owner may lose his title through inadvertence. 	Precedent
But the main provisions of that Act have not yet been brought into effect, and even if they had it would not assist Pye, whose title had been lost before the passing of the Act. 	Precedent
While I am satisfied that the appeal must be allowed for the reasons given by my noble and learned friend, this is a conclusion which I (like the judge [Neuberger J]...) 'arrive at with no enthusiasm'. "
"48.  Thereafter the applicants moved the European Commission of Human Rights (ECHR) alleging that the United Kingdom law on adverse possession, by which they lost land to a neighbour, operated in violation of article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (""the Convention""). "
"It was contended by the applicants that they had been deprived of their land by the operation of the domestic law on adverse possession which is in contravention with article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (""the Convention""), which reads as under: "
"Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. 	Precedent
No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law. 	Precedent
The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties. "
"49.  The European Council of Human Rights importantly laid down three pronged test to judge the interference of government with the right of ""peaceful enjoyment of property"". "
"While referring to Beyeler v. Italy [GC], No. 33202/96, '' 108-14, ECHR 2000-I, it was held that the ""interference"" should comply with the principle of lawfulness pursue a legitimate aim (public interest) by means reasonably proportionate to the aim sought to be realized. "
In fine the court observed: 
"The question nevertheless remains whether, even having regard to the lack of care and inadvertence on the part of the applicants and their advisers, the deprivation of their title to the registered land and the transfer of beneficial ownership to those in unauthorised possession struck a fair balance with any legitimate public interest served. 	Precedent
In these circumstances, the Court concludes that the application of the provisions of the 1925 and 1980 Acts to deprive the applicant companies of their title to the registered land imposed on them an individual and excessive burden and upset the fair balance between the demands of the public interest on the one hand and the applicants' right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions on the other. 	Precedent
There has therefore been a violation of article 1 of Protocol No. 1. "
50.  The question of the application of article 41 was referred for the Grand Chamber Hearing of the ECHR. 
This case sets the field of Adverse Possession and its interface with the right to peaceful enjoyment in all its complexity. 
51.  Therefore it will have to be kept in mind the Courts around the world are taking an unkind view toward statutes of limitation overriding property rights. 
THE PRESENT CASE 
52.  It is to be borne in mind that the respondent had already purchased 1 acre 21 guntas out of the 5 acres 25 guntas under a duly registered deed dated 1.9.1933. 
Appellant bought the entire chunk of 5 acres 23 guntas subsequent to the respondent's transaction. 
The validity of such sale is not the question in the instant case but the transaction relating to 1 acre 23 Guntas remains an important surrounding circumstance to assess the nature of appellant's possession. 
The question is whether it is a case of mistaken possession ignoramus of the previous sale or adverse possession having the mental element in the requisite degree to dispossess. 
"Also much depends on the answer to the query regarding the starting point of adverse possession: when can the possession be considered to have become adverse? In the facts and circumstances of this case, the possession of appellant was effected through the sale deeds, dated 11.04.1934 and 5.07.1936. "
"Therefore, the alleged fact of adverse possession bears a pronounced backdrop of 1933 sale deed passing 1 acre 21 Guntas to the respondent. . "
53.  Are we to say that it is a sale with doubtful antecedents (1 acre 23 Guntas) sought to be perfected or completed through adverse possession? But that aspect of the matter is not under consideration herein. 
"As has already been mentioned, adverse possession is a right which comes into play not just because someone loses his right to reclaim the property out of continuous and will ful neglect but also on account of possessor's positive intent to dispossess. "
"Therefore it is important to take into account before stripping somebody of his lawful title, whether there is an adverse possessor worthy and exhibiting more urgent and genuine desire to dispossess and step into the shoes of the paper-owner of the property. "
This test forms the basis of decision in the instant case. 
54.  The argument for a more intrusive inquiry for adverse possession must not be taken to be against the law of limitations. 
Limitation statutes as statutes of repose have utility and convenience as their purpose. 
"Nevertheless, there has been change on this front as well which have been noticed by us here to before. "
"55.  For the reasons aforementioned, there is no merit in this appeal which is dismissed accordingly with costs. "
"Counsel's fee assessed at Rs. 25,000/-. "
Appeal Allowed. 
"1.  Order passed in four appeals filed by the respondents questioning correctness of order dated 10th February, 2006 passed by a learned Single Judge of Calcutta High Court form the subject matter of challenge in this appeal. "
"A learned Single Judge had set aside the order dated 28.12.2004 passed by the Controller of Patents and Designs (in short the 'Controller') and remanded the matter to him for arriving at a fresh decision on the application of the writ petitioners for exclusive marketing right according to law that existed on 3rd May, 2002. "
The Controller was also asked to consider the report of the examiner dated 28.7.2000. 
2.  Background facts giving rise to the filing of the writ petition were as follows: 
"The writ petitioners filed an application for grant of patent under Section 5(2) of the Patents Act, 1970 (in short the 'Act') on 28th August, 1998. "
"Subsequently, on 30th June, 2000 the writ petitioners further filed an application for grant of ""Exclusive Marketing Right"" (in short the 'EMR'). "
"On July 28, 2000 the examiner filed examination report as regards the claim of the writ petitioners for grant of EMR. "
"The Controller of Patent, however, by order dated 3rd May, 2002 refused the prayer of the writ petitioners for EMR. "
"Being dissatisfied, two different writ applications were filed before the High Court being W.P.No.20469(W) of 2004 and W.P.No.20407(W) of 2004 and a learned Single Judge of the High Court set aside the order dated 3rd May, 2002 and directed the Joint Controller of Patent to consider and give order on the application for grant of EMR afresh keeping all points open. "
"Pursuant to the order of the learned Single Jude, dated 16th December, 2004, the Controller of Patent again rejected the application filed by the writ petitioners on December 28, 2004. "
"On January 1, 2005 the Patent (Amendment Act), 2005 came into operation by which various amendments to the Act were made and the Chapter IV-A which provided the mode of adjudication of the claim of EMR was totally deleted. "
"On June 9, 2005 the writ petitioners filed another writ application thereby challenging the order dated 28th December, 2004 passed by the Controller of Patent by which the prayer for the EMR of the writ petitioners was rejected for the second time. "
"Challenging the correctness of order passed by the learned Single Judge, the Controller of Patent and the Union of India filed two appeals, while two others were preferred by a third party to the proceedings who wanted to be added as party-respondent in the writ application. "
"The appellants raised a preliminary objection as regards maintainability of the writ petition after coming into operation of amendments into the Act w.e.f. 1st January, 2005. "
"According to the appellants before the High Court, with effect from 1st January, 2005 there was no scope for further considering the question of EMR as Chapter IVA of the Act has been deleted and in Section 78 of the Amending Act, it has been specifically made clear that all pending applications for grant of EMR filed under Chapter IV-A of the Principal Act which were pending on 1st January, 2005 should be treated to be a claim for patents covered under sub-section (2) of Section 5 of the Principal Act and such application should be deemed to be treated as a request for examination of grant of patents under sub-section (3) of Section 11(B) of the Act. "
"The stand essentially was that there was no scope for considering any pending cases for grant of EMR after 1st January, 2005 and in any case the applications relating to grant of EMR disposed of earlier cannot be revived for consideration. "
"Stand of the present appellants was that on the first day of January, 2005 there was no pending application filed by the writ petitioner for grant of EMR and the transitional provision in Section 78 of the Act has no application to the facts of the case. "
"It was pointed out that since the prayer for EMR was disposed of at a point of time when the amendment had not come into operation, therefore, there was a vested right to challenge the order before an appropriate forum in accordance with law. "
The High Court was of the view that the preliminary objection regarding maintainability of the writ petition was to be accepted and therefore appeals were allowed. 
"So far as the third parties are concerned, the merits were not gone into. "
12.  Learned counsel for the appellants in support of the appeal submitted that a crystalised right had accrued because of Section 24A and 24B and the original orders dated 3.5.2002 and 16.12.2004 were under challenge. 
The order dated 28.12.2004 was passed on remand and the learned Single Judge by order dated 10.2.2006 set aside the order. 
The impugned order speaks of repeal. 
Reference is made to Section 24B(1) about the right having accrued. 
13.  Learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand submitted that the intention of the statute appears to be to the contrary. 
"Therefore, the transitional provision clearly applies even if it is treated to be pending under Section 11B (3). "
"14.  To the present case, Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 (in short the 'General Clauses Act') applies. "
It reads as follows: 
Effect of repeal:- 
"Where this Act, or any Central Act or Regulation made after the commencement of this Act, repeals any enactment hitherto made or hereafter to be made, then unless a different intention appears, the repeal shall not- "
(a) revive anything not in fore or existing at the time at which the repeal takes effect; or 
(b) affect the previous operation of any enactment so repealed or anything duly done or suffered thereunder; or 
"(c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under any enactment so repealed; or "
"(d) affect any penalty, forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any offence committed against any enactment so repealed; or "
"(e) affect any investigation, legal proceedings or remedy in respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid; and any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced, and any such penalty, forfeiture or punishment may be imposed as if the repealing Act of Regulation had not been passed."" "
Section 24B(1) of the Act reads as follows: 
Grant of exclusive of rights - (1) Where a claim for patent covered under sub-section 2 of section 5 has been made and the applicant has - 
"(a) where an invention has been made whether in India or a country other than India and before filing search a claim, filed an application for the same invention claiming identical article or substance in a convention country on or after the Ist day of January, 1995 and the patent and the approval to sell or distribute the article or substance on the basis of appropriate tests conducted on or after the Ist day of January, 1995 in that country has been granted or after the date of making claim for patent covered under sub-section 2 of section 5; or "
"(b) where an invention has been made in India and before filing search a claim, made a claim for patent on or after the Ist day of January, 1995 for method or a process of manufacture for that invention relating to identical article or substance and has been granted in India the patent therefor on or after the making the claim for patent covered under sub-section 2 of section 5, and has been received the approval to sell or distribute the article or substance from the authority specify in this behalf by the Central Government, then, we shall have the exclusive right by himself, his agents or licencee to sell or distribute in India the article or the substance on or from the date of approval granted by the Controller in this behalf till a period of five years or till the date of grant of patent or the date of rejection of application for the grant of patent, whichever is earlier."" "
16.  As was observed by this Court in M/s Hoosain Kasam Dada (India) Ltd. v. The State of Madhya Pradesh and Ors. 
"(AIR 1953 SC 221) 1953 Indlaw SC 2 when pre existing right of appeal continues to exist, by necessary implication the old law which created the right of appeal also exists to support the continuation of that right and hence the old right must govern the exercise and enforcement of that right. "
"In the absence of contrary intention in repealing the enactment, rights under the old statute are not destroyed. "
In M/s Gurcharan Singh Baldev Singh v. Yashwant Singh and Ors. 
"(1992 (1) SCC 428) 1991 Indlaw SC 724, it was observed that right to proper consideration of an application by statutory authority remains alive even after repeal of the enactment under which the consideration had been sought. "
17.  In Chief Adjudication Officer v. Maguire (Simon Brown LJ) (1999 (2) All ER 859) it was observed as follows: 
"Inchoate rights, obligations and liabilities are covered by (c). 	Precedent
This was established by Free Lanka Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Ranasinghe (1964 (1) All ER 457). 	Precedent
In that case the Privy Council had no difficulty in construing the Ceylon Interpretation Ordinance 1900 as including an inchoate or contingent right and the same approach should be adopted to the interpretation of right"", ""obligation"" or ""liability"" in section 16 of the 1978 Act. "
"The section clearly contemplates that there will be situations where an investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may have to be instituted before the right or liability can be enforced and this supports this approach."" "
18.  The learned Single Judge's view that the provisions of Section 78 of the Amendment Act have no application to the proceedings which stood concluded before the appointed day appears to be the correct view governing the issue. 
"Since the Chapter IV-A in question was merely repealed, the situation has to be dealt with in line with Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. "
The provisions of Section 78 are conditional provisions and are not intended to cover cases where the application for EMR had been rejected with reference to Section 21 of the Amending enactment. 
"As noted above, Chapter IV A was repealed. "
The effect of the repeal has to be ascertained in the background of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. 
"That being so, the order of the Division Bench cannot be sustained and that of the learned Single Judge has to operate. "
The appeal is allowed but in the circumstances without any order as to costs. 
Appeal allowed 
Delay condoned.
Leave granted.

"It is a classic case where the members of the above referred to society got themselves entangled in a series of litigations and to add to this, some orders were passed by the officials of the Department of Cooperative Society of Andhra Pradesh, which has created pandemonium by virtue of the divergent orders passed at different points of time and, therefore, requires the consideration of this Court to pass appropriate orders and put an end to this complicated litigation once and for all.

"The entire dispute amongst the members of the society pertains to a piece of land, which was purchased by the society in pursuance of its object of getting some benefit for its members for providing housing accommodation. "
"Before delving deep into the controversy, raised in this litigation, it is necessary to set out the different Special Leave Petitions filed before us, wherein orders have been challenged by different Appellants which ultimately, as pointed out by us, pertains to the issue relating to the land purchased by the society for providing housing accommodation.

"Bye-Law No.22 states the maximum period up to which the Managing Committee can function and the consequences of the proceedings becoming invalid on account of any vacancy or vacancies in the Committee, which remained unfilled. "

(vi) empowers the General Body to deal with the expulsion of a member. 
Bye-Law No.37(b) makes it clear that the General Body Meeting should consist of all the members of the society. 
"Keeping the abovesaid prescriptions in the Bye-Laws, when we proceed to analyze the various facts involved, we find that the society in the first instance had a membership of 28 members at the time of formation of the society in the year 1982, which rose to 43 as on 30.06.1982 and gradually the membership went up to 75 as on 31.03.1997, when 37 members stated to have got admitted in the year 1996. "
"In fact, the whole controversy pertains to the admission of those 37 persons as members whose aspirations to get an allotment in the land originally purchased with the funds provided by the 11 founder members gave scope for this controversial and complicated litigation amongst themselves. "
"In the year 1982, the society purchased a land measuring 1 acre 14 guntas in Survey No.233 of Thokatta Village. "
The entire land cost was paid by 11 of the founder members. 
"In one of the statements placed before this Court, discloses that as on 30.06.1984, the advances collected from the members towards the land cost were Rs.64,000/- and that the contributors were 33 in number, two of whom stated to have got back the advance deposited by them with the society. "
"Be that as it may, the Deputy Registrar of Cooperative Societies Housing in a letter dated 25.09.1996, addressed to the President and Secretary of the Society, referred to a representation received from Shri Srinivasa Rao and others, alleging that the Managing Committee in their Meeting refused to enroll them as members of the society. "
This was referred to the Cooperative Sub-Registrar by the office of the Deputy Registrar. 
"On receipt of the report of the Cooperative Sub- Registrar, in the said communication dated 25.09.1996, the Deputy Registrar indicated to the society that the request of Shri Srinivasa Rao and others are genuine and that they are eligible to become members of the society and, therefore, they should be admitted as members. "
The admission of their membership was also directed to be intimated to the office of the Deputy Registrar. 
"In the minutes of the Executive Committee Meeting, stated to have been held on 03.10.1996 at 6 p.m., it was stated that as per the agenda dated 18.09.1996, the matter of admitting the 37 new applicants into the society was thoroughly discussed and unanimously decided to admit them as members. "
"The said minutes, however, state that with the cooperation of new entrants, a suitable piece of land can be purchased for the interested new members and that the 37 members or any other member who wish to share a plot will be accommodated in the land to be purchased as a second venture of the society. "
"By a letter dated 04.10.1996 addressed to the Deputy Registrar, Housing, the society confirmed the above resolution passed admitting the 37 new applicants as members in the Meeting held on 03.10.1996. "
"Subsequently, the General Body Meeting was stated to have been held on 04.04.1997 at 6 p.m. in the society's premises. "
The agenda was to ratify the admission of the new members and also to explore the possibilities for a new venture. 
The resolution relating to ratification was passed and it was ratified. 
The other issues were discussed in the General Body Meeting. 
"It was deliberated that since the new members did not join at the time when the land was purchased and for purchasing the said land the contribution was made only by the 11 members who continued to be members on the date of the General Body Meeting, they alone will have the right to get allotment in the said lands. "
"By proceedings dated 17.04.1997, a general direction section 4(2) of the Andhra Pradesh Cooperative Society Act, 1964 (hereinafter referred to 'the Act') was issued by the Registrar of Cooperative Societies, which inter alia contained a direction that no society shall admit any new members to be in waiting in service, except to the extent of maximum of 10% of members provided with the plots at any given time. "
"It was further directed that no member of the society, who is not allotted a house or house site, shall be eligible to vote in the ensuing elections unless he completes one year as a member in the society. "
The electoral authorities were directed to take into consideration the said aspect while preparing the electoral roll of the members of the society. 
"By virtue of section 4(2) of the Act, all the cooperative societies were directed to comply with the above directions. "
"Pursuant to the general direction issued on 17.04.1997, the Deputy Registrar came forward with a fresh communication to the society dated 01.12.1998, stating that the instructions issued by its office in its letter dated 25.09.1996, stood withdrawn with immediate effect. "
"Closely followed by that, by a communication dated 20.07.1999, the members who were admitted in the Meeting held on 03.10.1996 were informed that subsequent to their admission, a resolution was passed in the committee Meeting held on 16.07.1999 to expel all the 37 members. "
The membership fee of Rs.100 was also returned in the form of a cheque. 
"The said letter dated 20.07.1999 made a reference to a Writ Petition, namely, W.P. No.3720 of 1999, filed by Mr. K. Srinivasa Rao, challenging the Deputy Registrar's direction dated 01.12.1998, which was stated to have been dismissed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court on 13.07.1999. "
"As against the order of the Single Judge dated 13.07.1999, in W.P. No.3720 of 1999, Srinivasa Rao preferred a Writ Appeal No.1056 of 1999. "
The Division Bench passed the following order in the said Writ Appeal: 
"In view of the peculiar facts and circumstances, the observation of the learned single Judge that the petitioner has not been adversely affected by the withdrawal of the instructions cannot be sustained as has been demonstrated by the subsequent order passed by the society, which has been placed on record in this appeal. 	Ruling by Lower Court
In our considered view and the observations made above, the order dated 20.7.1999 passed during the pendency of the appeal is liable to be set aside and it is accordingly set aside. 	Ruling by Lower Court
In view of the fact that the membership of the petitioner-appellant was cancelled without taking a decision on merits, it is left open to the society to decide with respect to the membership of the petitioner- appellant on merits in accordance with law and without taking into consideration the instructions issued by the Deputy Registrar or the Registrar of co-operative Societies and after hearing the appellant. 	Ruling by Lower Court
The writ appeal is disposed of accordingly. 	Ruling by Lower Court
No costs. "
"25 other members who were identically placed like that of Mr. Srinivasa Rao, filed Writ Petition No.18294 of 1999. "
"A Single Judge of the Andhra Pradesh High Court relying upon the Division Bench order dated 02.08.1999 in Writ Appeal No.1056 of 1999, set aside the proceedings of the Society dated 20.07.1999 and directed them to follow the directions of the Division Bench referred to above. "
"Thereafter, the society issued a show cause notice dated 06.10.1999 to the 37 members, wherein after making reference to the order of the Division Bench in Writ Appeal No.1056 of 1999 dated 02.08.1999 and the order dated 01.09.1999 in Writ Petition No.18294 of 1999, called upon the members to show cause as to why they should not be expelled in as much no land is available to admit any member to the society. "
"That apart, at the instance of one K. Sivarama Raju and C. Viswam, a Writ Petition in W.P. No.11268 of 2000 was filed, who claimed to be the founder members. "
"The said writ petition was disposed of by a Single Judge of the Andhra Pradesh High Court by order dated 18.11.2000, in which reference was made to the order of the Division Bench in Writ Appeal No.1056 of 1999 and the connected Writ Petitions and certain other Miscellaneous petitions filed in that writ petition. "
"Ultimately, the learned Judge observed as under in the penultimate paragraph of the judgment: "
"It is also urged by Sri Prasad, the learned counsel for the applicant herein, that there are infirmities in the electoral roll which requires that electoral rolls are rectified. 	Ruling by Lower Court
This argument is advanced on the premise that the 37 new members ought not to have formed part of the Electoral College. 	Ruling by Lower Court
This contention is misconceived and does not command consideration by this court. 	Ruling by Lower Court
The 37 members, including the writ petitioners are as on date valid members of the society not having been divested of such membership by any formal proceedings issued in due conformity with law. 	Ruling by Lower Court
Be that as it may alleged deficiencies in the electoral roll are not a ground relevant to interdict the democratic process of election to a cooperative society. 	Ruling by Lower Court
The contention is accordingly rejected. "
"Yet another proceeding relating to the launching of prosecution at the instance of the Registrar of Cooperative Societies on the basis of the alleged misappropriation of societies funds was initiated and subsequently an order came to be passed by the Government of Andhra Pradesh, Housing Department dated 29.03.2004, in Memo No.2768/CH1/2003-9. "
"By the said order, the Government while setting aside the proceedings initiated by the Registrar of Cooperative Societies also observed that the existing committee which came into being with the support of the invalid votes of the 37 disputed members, who participated in the elections should be declared as null and void and that the 37 disputed members should be replaced to set right the affairs of the society. "
The said part of the order dated 29.03.2004 declaring the membership of the 37 persons as invalid was challenged by the society by filing Writ Petition No.7794 of 2004 before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh. 
"By order dated 15.12.2006, the learned Single Judge while affirming the order dated 29.03.2004, insofar as it set aside the proceedings of the Registrar dated 15.01.2002 and 25.01.2002, however, held that the findings arrived at by the State Government, insofar as it related to the election of the existing committee members and allotments of plots to the 11 member have to be treated as non est in law, since the First Respondent has gone into the question which was not canvassed before it. "
"In pursuance of the order passed in Writ Appeal No.1056 of 1999 and Writ Petition No.18294 of 1999, the Divisional Cooperative Officer, by his order dated 02.04.2004, decided to authorize the Sub-Divisional Cooperative Officer, Secunderabad Mandal, to convene the General Body Meeting of the society to decide the issue of membership. "
"The Divisional Cooperative Officer passed further order on 22.12.2004 and gave further directions authorizing the Sub-Divisional Cooperative Officer, Secunderabad Mandal, to convene the General Body Meeting for deciding the membership in pursuance of the orders of the High Court in Writ Appeal No.1056 of 1999 dated 02.08.1999 and the order of the Single Judge in Writ Petition No.18294 of 1999 dated 01.09.1999. "
"Pursuant to the said direction, the date and time for the General Body Meeting was fixed on 22.05.2005 at 11.30 a.m. Though, as scheduled, the members stated to have assembled on 22.05.2005, the Presiding Officer did not commence the Meeting. "
"Therefore, the Meeting, as directed by the Sub-Divisional Cooperative Officer, did not take place. "
"Nevertheless, 15 of the members stated to have proceeded with the Meeting and passed some resolution adverse to the interest of the 37 members and forwarded the same to the Officers of the Cooperative Society. "
"But, by a communication dated 04.06.2005, the Deputy Registrar of Cooperative Society addressed the society and made it clear that the issue of convening the General Body Meeting was re-examined by the Deputy Registrar and in the light of the order dated 08.11.2000 in Writ Petition No.11268 of 2000 and the interim order dated 26.04.2004 in Writ Petition No.7794 of 2004 it was decided not to proceed with the proposed General Body Meeting on 22.05.2005. "
"The said communication also revealed that the Sub-Divisional Cooperative Officer, who convened the General Body Meeting, explained the said position to the members on 22.05.2005, that there would be no discussion on the agenda and the General Body Meeting would not take place. "
"Ultimately, the so-called resolution claimed to have been passed by 15 of the members was held to be invalid. "
"There was also Writ Petition filed in W.P. No.701 of 2003, wherein there was a challenge to an order of the Andhra Pradesh Cooperative Tribunal in C.T.A. No.160 of 2000, by which the Tribunal set aside an award A.R.C 3 of 1998 dated 10.03.2002, passed by the Joint Registrar. "
The said Writ Petition came to be dismissed upholding the order of the Tribunal. 
"The sum and substance of the order of the Tribunal was that the so-called allotment of lands, to the promoting members, anticipating the approval of the layout was not valid and, therefore, the resolution passed by the Society allotting the plots to the founder members, subject to the approval of the layout was held to be arbitrary and illegal. "
The Writ Petition preferred by the so-called founder members was dismissed with an observation that the said order would not preclude the General Body from considering the allotment of plots in favour of the members of the society after the layout is sanctioned by taking into consideration their seniority as per the Bye-Laws concerning allotment of plots. 
"Having noted the development after the emergence of the society and after its registration, as well as the issue relating to the admission of the new members to the society and the various orders passed by the officers of the department of the society, as well as the High Court, before examining the correctness of the orders impugned in these appeals, it will be necessary to note the provisions of the Bye-Laws to ascertain as to the rights of the original members and the members who claim to have been subsequently admitted into the society. "
There is no controversy that the object of the society is for the benefit of getting housing facility for its members in accordance with the cooperative principles. 
The object has been succinctly stated in Bye-Law No.2. 
"As far as membership is concerned, the eligibility has been prescribed in Bye-Law No.5, which reads as under: "
"MEMBERSHIP ELIGIBILITY: 	Ratio of the decision
Any individual who has attained majority; and who is competent to contract and of sound mind and who did not have any house in city in his name or in the name of his wife or minor children and who is not a member in any other house building society in the same area shall be eligible for admission as member, minor may be admitted as associate member through their legal guardians, but they shall not be eligible to vote or have any interest in profit. "
"A reading of Bye-Law No.5 disclose that in order to be eligible to become a member, an individual should be a major, he should be of sound mind, he should not have any house in the city in his name or in the name of his wife or minor children and that he should not be a member of any other house building society in the same area. "
"If the above conditions are satisfied, he would be eligible to become a member. "
"Though, the Bye-Laws do not specifically state that such an individual should be an employee of the Voltas Company, since the very society was formed by the employees of Voltas and the name itself makes it clear that the society was formed by the employees of the Voltas for providing housing facility, it is imperative that the individual should be an employee of Voltas. "
"As per Bye-Law No.6 read along with Bye-Law No.4, one who seeks to become a member should be a shareholder and the cost of such share has been fixed at Rs.100, made up of 5000 shares, which would form the capital of the society. "
"When an application for admission as a member for allotment of the share is made to the Secretary of the society in the prescribed form, such an application should be disposed of by the Managing Committee, who has been empowered to grant admission and allot shares or refuse the sane. "
"In the event of refusing to allot a share, reasons will have to be adduced. "
"Bye-Law No.6(b) also states that if no such decision is communicated within the prescribed time, then within 50 days from the date of application for membership, the society shall be deemed to have admitted such applicant as a member on the date of expiration of 60 days from the date of application and the Secretary should give effect to such admission. "
"Once a person is admitted as a member of the society by virtue of Bye-Law No.7, he will be eligible for the services of the society. "
"After the membership of a person into the society is confirmed, his exit from the society can be either by way of disqualification as provided under Bye-Law No.8, or by way of withdrawal of share capital under Bye-Law No.12 or by way of an expulsion under Bye-Law No.16. "
"If the exit of a membership is by way of a disqualification, it should come under any one of the sub-cls. "
(i) to (iv) of Bye-Law No.8. 
"If it is by way of withdrawal of share capital, as provided under Bye-Law No.12, then again the stipulation contained in the said Bye-Law should be fulfilled. "
"If a member is to be expelled, specific procedure has been prescribed under Bye-Law No.16(1) and in the event of any resolution for expulsion having been passed as prescribed under Bye-Law No.16(1), such expulsion should have the approval of the Registrar of Cooperative Societies under Bye-Law No.16(2). "
"Therefore, an expulsion of a member cannot be claimed to be made by a mere stand taken by the society. "
"There must be an order of approval of the Registrar of Cooperative Society confirming the expulsion resorted to as proscribed under Bye-Law No.16(1) or otherwise, such an expulsion of membership claimed by the society cannot be valid. "
"One other provision in the Bye-Law to be noted is the term of the Managing Committee, which has been prescribed under Bye-Law No.22. "
"It states that such term shall be for a period of 3 years and that any proceedings of the Managing Committee should be invalidated on account of any vacancy or vacancies of the Committee, which may remain unfilled. "
"Under the said Bye-Law, it is stipulated that all the members of the committee would vacate their office on the expiry of the term of the office of the committee. "
These are all the salient features in the Bye-Laws. 
"Apart from the above specific provisions, under Bye-Law No.36, it is stated that the ultimate authority in all matters relating to the administration of the society, shall vest in the General Body. "
Even an expulsion of a member is one of the specific powers to be exercised only by the General Body. 
"Keeping the abovesaid prescription in the Bye-Law, when we examine the emergence of the society and the subsequent events, it is not in dispute that at the time of formation of the society, the founder members were 28 in number in the year 1981. "
"A list of members, as from the year 1981-82 onwards, disclose that as on 30.06.1982, the membership went up to 43, which remained constant, though there was a slight increase in the membership up to 56 sometime in the year 1988. "
"As on 31.03.1997, the total number of members were 75. "
"Be that as it may, when the society purchased the land admeasuring 1 acre 14 guntas in Survey No.233 of Thokatta Village in the year 1982, it is stated that the cost of the land was incurred by 11 of the members of the society, namely, M. Balakrishnan, K. Sivarama Raju, V. Sivaramakrishna, P.S. Sastry, N. Suryaprakash Rao, K. Bhaktavatsalam, T.S. Benerjee, T.N. Shankar, C. Viswam, U. Talapathi and K.G.K. Murthy. "
"It is also mentioned in one other statement that the land cost was collected from the other members in the year 1983-84, as per which statement the total investment was in a sum of Rs.64,000/-. "
"While the purchase of the land came to be made, as above, by the society and the process of providing housing facility was being examined and was pending till the year 1996, the issue relating to the admission of 37 persons as members of the society cropped up. "
"Therefore, before arriving at any definite conclusion as to how the housing facility in respect of the land already purchased, namely, 1 acre and 14 guntas in Thokatta Village is to be dealt with, we will have to steer clear of the membership of the society, in particular about the claim of the 37 persons as having become members of the society, who also claim their right to have a share in the land already purchased by the society for distribution in the form of housing accommodation. "
"Insofar as the said claim of the 37 members is concerned, the first document is the letter dated 25.09.1996 of the Deputy Registrar of Cooperative Society, addressed to the society by which the society was requested to admit them as members and intimate the same to the Deputy Registrar. "
"Pursuant to the said letter, the minutes of the Executive Committee Meeting of the Society dated 03.10.1996, disclose that as per the agenda dated 18.09.1996, the matter relating to admission of 37 applicants was thoroughly discussed and unanimously decided to admit them as members. "
"The minutes of the said Meeting, however, stated that their claim for a share in the land already purchased, cannot be considered as such a claim would be considered in a different venture. "
"Confirming the admission of those 37 members, a communication was also sent to the Deputy Registrar by the society on 04.10.1996. "
"That apart, there was a General Body Meeting held on 04.04.1997, which discloses that the admission of the 37 members to the society was also ratified by the General Body, though their claim in respect to the land purchased in the Thokatta Village was not acceded to in the General Body. "
"From the above proceedings, it must be stated that the admission of the 37 members to the society was a concluded issue as on the date of the General Body, namely, 04.04.1997. "
"However, the offices of the Cooperative Department took a sudden u-turn in the year 1998, when the Deputy Registrar issued a communication to the society on 01.12.1998, stating that the instructions issued by it in its letter dated 25.09.1996 was to be treated as withdrawn based on the proceedings of the Registrar of Cooperative Societies dated 17.04.1997. "
It will have to be stated that the said stand of the Deputy Registrar Cooperative Societies is not permissible in law and we do not find any support for such a stand either based on any Statutory Provision or any other rule or regulation. 
"That apart, when based on the said communication dated 01.12.1998, the society wanted to withdraw the membership of the 37 persons, the issue went before the High Court by way of Writ Petition No.3720 of 1999, which was rejected by the learned Singh Judge in Writ Appeal No.1056 of 1999, the proceedings of the society dated 20.07.1999, withdrawing the membership, was set aside with the observation that it is open to the society to decide one way or the other with respect to the membership of one of the 37 members. "
"The said conclusion was followed in respect of 25 other persons among the 37 members when their Writ Petition in W.P. No.18294 of 1999 was decided by order dated 01.09.1999, wherein the conclusion in Writ Appeal No.1056 of 1999 was followed. "
"Though, the society wanted to initiate proceedings by issuing show cause notice on 06.10.1999, the fact remains that the said show cause notice was not pursued. "
"On the other hand, in Writ Petition No.11268 of 2011 by order dated 18.11.2000, the High Court virtually declared that the 37 members, including the writ petitioners, had become valid members as on the date of the order as society not having divested of such membership in any formal proceedings in due conformity with the law. "
It was stated in the said order that any alleged deficiencies in the electoral roll cannot be a relevant ground to interdict the democratic process of elections to a cooperative society and the contention that the 37 new members cannot form part of the Electoral College was rejected. 
"It must be pointed out that the said order of the learned Single Judge dated 18.11.2000 passed in W.P. No.11268 of 2011 was not varied at any point of time in any subsequent proceedings, either in an appeal or by any other valid order passed by the society. "
"In fact, subsequently, while dealing with an issue relating to the prosecution of the members for alleged misappropriation when the State Government passed an order on 29.03.2004, it was innocuously stated that the disputed membership of 37 persons cannot be accepted, as their membership was not valid. "
The said order was challenged in a separate writ petition in W.P. No.7794 of 2004 and the said part of the order was also set aside by the High Court in the order dated 15.12.2006. 
Here again it must be stated that the said order in W.P. No.7794 of 2004 has become final and conclusive as the same was not challenged in the manner known to law. 
The said writ petition was filed by the society itself. 
"The net result was that by virtue of the orders passed in W.P. No.11268 of 2000 dated 18.11.2000 and the order dated 15.12.2006 in W.P. No.7794 of 2004, the validity of membership of these 37 persons was beyond the pale of controversy. "
"One other factor which has also to be noted is that belatedly, an attempt was made by the department in a proceeding dated 02.04.2004, to deal with the validity of membership of these 37 person by directing one of its officers, namely, the Sub-Divisional Cooperative Officer to call for a General Body Meeting of the society and decide the issue relating to the membership. "
"Pursuant to the said proceeding, though a General Body Meeting was called for by the said officer and a date was also fixed as 22.05.2005, the said Meeting was not convened, since the proceedings of the Deputy Registrar dated 04.06.2005 made it clear the that the Sub-Divisional Cooperative Officer who convened the General Body Meeting, explained to the members on 22.05.2005 and made it clear that there would not be any discussion on the agenda, namely, about the validity of the admission of the 37 members and that there was no General Body Meeting as proposed to be convened. "
"Therefore, as pointed out by us earlier, the admission of the 37 members based on the Meeting dated 03.10.1996, can no longer be in controversy as it was a concluded issue. "
"Even while holding so, it must be noted that if at all the membership of the 37 persons were to be cancelled, the same could have been done by applying any of the relevant provisions in the Bye-Law, namely, on the ground of eligibility as provided under By-Law No.5 or by way of disqualification as provided under Bye-Law No.8 or by withdrawal of share capital as provided under Bye-Law No.12 or by way of an expulsion as stipulated in Bye-Law No.16. "
"As far as the eligibility criteria is concerned, it was not pointed out before us that any of the 37 members lacked such eligibility as stipulated in Bye-Law No.5. "
It was also not pointed out before us in the form of any acceptable material that any of the 37 members suffered disqualification as provided under Bye-Law No.8. 
"As far as application of Bye-Law No.12 is concerned, it must be stated that out of 37 members, 10 have accepted their refund of share capital and as on date, only 27 out of the 37 remain, who returned the cheques issued by the society during the year 1999, along with proceeding dated 20.07.1999. "
"When we come to the expulsion of membership, it is not the case of either the society or any of the rival claimants that any such proceeding for such expulsion, as stipulated under Bye-Law No.16, was carried out and that such proceeding was also approved by the Registrar. "
"In such circumstances, in the absence of any such valid order of approval by the Registrar relating to the expulsion of the newly added members, there is no question of the remaining 27 members having ceased to be the members of the society. "
"Keeping the above factors in mind, relating to the 37 members, now 27, the only other question which remains to be considered is as to the entitlement of the members of the society for a housing accommodation in the land admeasuring 1 acre 14 guntas in Survey No. 233 of Thokatta Village. "
"When we consider the said issue, the claim of the so- called 11 founder members is that the entire value of the land was borne by them and, therefore, they are exclusively entitled to the distribution of the land amongst themselves. "
Such a claim was distinctly mentioned in the General Body Meeting of the society held on 04.04.1997. 
"In fact, there was a serious deliberation and discussion in the said Meeting relating to the said issue and the minutes of the General Body Meeting states as under: "
"It was explained that since new members did not join in the venture, the then existing 11 members, who have decided to continue in the venture, contributed all the extra amounts to refund the amounts to the members, who resigned from the land advance on their own accord. 	Facts

K.G.K. Murthy are the only members who have right to the existing land venture in section No.233 of Thokatta village and it is not possible to admit any further members after lapse of so many years in the existing venture. 	Facts
However, the chair expressed that interested members can explore the possibility of any new venture and all assistance will be given for the same. "
"Though, such a stand was expressed by the Chair in the General Body Meeting, no definite conclusion to that effect was arrived at in the General Body Meeting. "
"Besides such a claim made by the so called 11 founder members, it must be stated that such a claim will have to be tested on the anvil of the provisions contained in the Bye-Laws. "
"For this purpose, when we examine the provisions in the Bye-Laws, the object clause in Bye-Law No.2 states that the object of the society is to carry on for the benefit of its members, the trade of building and of buying, selling, hiring, letting and developing land in accordance with the cooperative principles, apart from giving loans to members for construction of new dwelling houses. "
"Therefore, the object is very explicit to the effect that it is for the benefit of the members and it should be in accordance with the cooperative principles. "
"Bye-Law No.4 prescribes the total share capital to be made up to 5000 shares of Rs.100 each, the other source of fund can be as prescribed in Bye-Law No.17. "
"Bye-Law No.17 under the head 'FUNDS' states that the society will ordinarily obtain funds from 10 sources, namely, share capital from the members, loan from the Government, deposits from members, entrance and other fees, AP Cooperative Housing Society's Federation Ltd., Scheduled and Nationalised Banks, BDA, LIC, Hadco and Voltas Ltd. There is no information as to whether any fund was gathered from any other source, except the share capital from the members and the funds invested by such of those members who initially formed the society and by those members who subsequently joined the society. "
"In fact, pursuant to a direction of this Court in the order dated 04.09.2012, to one of the queries, which was directed to be answered by the Registrar, it has come to light that the contribution for the sale deed was Rs.48,000/- though as per cash book the consideration paid was shown as Rs.2,60,000/-. "
"That apart, a list was annexed along with the answer to another query by way of Annexure 2, which disclose that the contribution in a sum of Rs.3,06,795/- came to be made by 34 members of the society, on different dates between 24.08.1982 and 30.04.1982. "
"To yet another query made by this Court by way of Annexure 4, it is disclosed that contributions were also made after 30.04.1982, i.e. between 11.10.1982 and 30.11.1989, in different sums ranging from Rs.5000/- to Rs.39,000/-, though many of the members got back their investments by way of refund, while some of the members continue to retain such investments. "
"To yet another query by way of Annexure 6, the Registrar has disclosed that as many as 34 members who sought such membership after 25.09.1996, have invested sums ranging from Rs.1500/- to Rs.2,40,000/-, in all a sum of Rs.17,48,569/-. "
For the said sum the break-up of the expenses has also been disclosed in the annexure. 
"De hors the question whether such investments made and the expenses incurred is to be scrutinized and the veracity of such expenses incurred by the society are to be accepted or not the fact emerges that the founder members, as well as those who subsequently came to be admitted as members, have invested large sums by way of deposits into the society. "
"The question for consideration, therefore, is how to treat those sums, once it was brought into the funds of the society. "
"In this context, Bye-Law No.17 assumes significance. "
"It will have to be stated that whatever maybe the intention of the members of the society, while making various deposits into the accounts of the society, since, the funds of the society can be regulated only as per the Bye-Laws of the society whatever sum invested by the members of the society, can be either towards the share capital, which cannot exceed 5000 shares of Rs.100 each or by way of deposits by the members as provided under Bye-Law No.17. "
"Since, the membership has been confirmed based on the shares acquired by each of the individuals, whatever other sum brought into the accounts of the society, can only be taken as the deposits of the members. "
"Therefore, the amount deposited by the individual members of the society can be utilized only to meet the cost of the land originally purchased nearly 1 acre and 14 guntas in Survey No.233 of Thokatta Village or for any future investment to be made in any other lands to be purchased or to be used for advancing any loan for the purpose of construction of building by the members. "
"In other words, the individual members cannot seek to claim that because the purchase of land in Survey No.233 was from and out of the amount advanced by them to the society, the land so purchased should be held to exclusively belong to those members. "
Such a claim of individual members cannot be accepted. 
"In fact, such a claim would run counter to the cooperative principles, which is the object of the society when it came to be formed. "
"Once the land in Survey No.233 in an extent of 1 acre and 14 guntas in Thokatta Village was purchased by the society, the property vests in the society. "
"Therefore, it is for the society to consider how to deal with the said land in accordance with the cooperative principles and the objects with which the society was formed as mentioned in the Bye-Laws. "
It is not for the individual members to claim in what manner the land should be dealt with for the purpose of distribution amongst its members. 
"At the risk of repetition, it will have to be stated that the members, who contributed their funds to the society, have no exclusive right to claim any share in the property on the ground that they made the investments for the purchase of the land. "
"The said claim of the members both founder members and those who came to be subsequently admitted in the society, therefore, stands rejected. "
"Therefore, to put it in clear and unambiguous terms, all those investments made either by the founder members or by the subsequent members other than those relating to the share capital, can only be taken as their deposits forming part of the funds of the society. "
"The society is, therefore, bound to account for such deposits made by the members from the relevant dates and whatever prevailing interest in the market should accrue to such deposits and depending upon the volition of the member, it is for the society to take a decision either for refund of the sum so deposited after a fixed period or for using the same to meet the cost of the land in the event of its ultimate distribution to its various members. "
"In this context, it will be appropriate to note the order of the learned Single Judge dated 14.12.2006, passed in W.P. No.701 of 2003, wherein the learned Judge held as under: "
"It is an admitted fact that the resolution was passed without there being an approved layout, as required under the bye- laws. 	Ruling by Lower Court
If that be so, there was no necessity for convening the Meeting and passing a resolution allotting certain plots in favour of the petitioners herein. 	Ruling by Lower Court
In view of this, the question as to whether there was a valid committee or not for passing the resolution need not be gone into. 	Ruling by Lower Court
Therefore, I am of the considered opinion that the appellate tribunal has not committed any error in passing the impugned orders warranting interference of this Court article 226 of the Constitution of India. 	Ruling by Lower Court
The Writ Petition is devoid of merits and it is accordingly dismissed. 	Ruling by Lower Court
However, this order will not preclude the general body, after the layout is sanctioned from considering the allotments of plots in favour of the members of the society by taking into consideration their seniority as per the bye-laws concerning allotment of plots. "
(underlining is ours) 
"We find that such a conclusion and direction made by the learned Single Judge in the said order in Writ Petition No.701 of 2003, is not only the only course but the appropriate course to be followed by the society. "
"In our considered view, any other attempt to deal with the land already purchased by the society, will not only run counter to the cooperative principles but will only create further complications and result in utter chaos and confusion. "
"Therefore, neither the founder members nor those who were subsequently inducted/admitted as members, can claim any preference or right of allotment in any particular manner, other than the manner in which the learned Judge has directed in the said order. "
"From what has been found in the above paragraphs, we ultimately issue the following directions: "
"(i) In order to comply with our other directions in this concluding paragraph, in the foremost, we direct the Registrar of the Cooperative Societies of Andhra Pradesh, to depute one of its responsible officer in the rank of Sub-Divisional Cooperative Officer to call for a General Body Meeting of the Society of all the members ascertained by it from the records of the society and conduct the election of the members of the Managing Committee as per the Bye-Laws of the society. "
"Such officer nominated by the Registrar should meticulously follow the required procedure for issuing the notice calling for the General Body Meeting for the purpose of electing the Managing Committee members, hold the election and declare the results of such election and report the same to the Registrar who shall publish the same in the society to enable the Managing Committee to take control of the society. "
"Such nominated officer shall also thereafter guide the Managing Committee for electing their other office bearers such as President, Secretary, etc., and after their successful election to the respective position, officially handover the management of the society to the Secretary so elected. "
The abovesaid exercise shall be carried out by the Registrar within a period of three months from the date of communication of this order. 
"After the completion of the said exercise, file a compliance report to this Court. "
"After the successful compliance of this direction, the rest of the directions contained in sub-cl. "
(ii) to (xi) shall be adhered to and carried out by the successfully elected office bearers and members of the Managing Committee in accordance with the Bye-Laws of the society. 
"It is made clear that while carrying out the direction contained in this clause, the officer nominated by the Registrar shall have complete authority in enumerating. "
"the members of the society, determine the date for the General Body Meeting, hold the election in the General Body for electing the members of the Managing Committee, thereafter enable the Managing Committee to elect the office bearer, namely, President, Vice- President, Secretary or any other office bearer and declare the results. "
It is needless to emphasize that this direction would apply to all concerned. 
"Only after complying with this direction, the Registrar shall file the compliance report into the Registry of this Court within one month after the compliance. "
"Thereafter, if any further directions are to be issued on this aspect, that will be considered by this Court as per law. "
"(ii) The society which emerged as from 29.10.1982, has to exist in perpetuity irrespective of anybody's claim as founder member or by way of membership acquired subsequently and thereby, claim any preferential right. "
"(iii) As the object of the society is to provide housing facilities to the members of the society in accordance with the cooperative principles, such a right should be made available to all the members in accordance with the bye laws of the society. "
"(iv) The right of 37 members as having been admitted to the society by its resolution dated 03.10.1996 is a concluded issue having been affirmed by various orders of the High Court, the same has now become final and absolute. "
"(v) Though the admission of the 37 members has become final and conclusive, such of those members who have accepted their deposits, both towards share capital or any other sum, which was forwarded to them by the society along with the notice dated 20.07.1999, ceased to be the members of the society. "
"Consequently, out of the 37 members admitted, only 27 members continue to remain. "
"(vi) Similarly, of the founder members who were stated to be 28 in number, as on date, accepting the claim of the remaining 11 members, who stated to have invested further sums into the society by way of deposits to enable the society to settle the claims of the other founder members, ceased to be the members of the society. "
"Thereby, among the founder members, only 11 members whose names have been mentioned in paragraph 24 continue to remain. "
(vii) The purchase of the land in Survey No.233 of Thokatta Village to the extent of 1 acre and 14 guntas belongs to the society and it is for the society to deal with the distribution of the said land in the manner known to law. 
"(viii) As far as the distribution is concerned, as has been rightly held in the order of the Learned Single Judge in W.P. No.701 of 2003 dated 14.12.2006, it will be appropriate for the society to prepare a layout of the said land with the help of chartered engineers and submit the same to the appropriate authorities for approval and based on such approved layout, depending upon the availability of either plots for sale or in the form of units to be constructed, the society shall decide to make such allotment of either plot or unit of the construction to be made based on the seniority of the members of the society. "
"(ix) Once such a distribution of the land in Survey No.233 is to be made by the society, it will be for the society to ensure that the amounts deposited by its members in whatever form, which is to be treated as deposit as provided under Bye-Law No.17, shall be taken into account with accrued interest on such deposits from the date of such deposit and give credit to while deciding the consideration to be paid by the members who would be eligible for the allotment of land/housing unit, based on the value that would be worked out by the Chartered Engineer. "
"While giving credit to such deposits made by the individual members, if any excess remains to be collected from the individual members, such payments shall be recovered before making such allotment and in the event of such members failing to make the payment within the time stipulated or express their desire to give up their right for allotment, it will be for the society to decide in an appropriate manner, in accordance with the Bye-Laws as to how the left out plot/housing unit should be allotted to the next member in the seniority for whom the right to claim such allotment would be available. "
(x) It is made clear that none of the members either founder members or the subsequent members can claim any right based on their investments on the footing that their investments enabled the society to purchase the land or that their investment was higher in value or on any other ground. 
"(xi) Any other investment to be made for housing projects, in accordance with the object of the society as per Bye- Law 2, shall be made by the society in future in accordance with the Bye-Laws and as well as in accordance with the other statutory provisions governing the housing society. "
"(xii) Since the above exercise will be carried out as per the directions of this Court in this judgment, we make it clear that any further orders/directions relating to this matter can be passed only by this Court and by no other Court/Tribunal in this Country. "
"In as much as our conclusion and directions were based on the various factors such as the interpretation of the Bye-Laws, the concluded orders of the High Court and the other uncontroverted facts culled out based on the records placed before us, as well as the report of the Registrar of the Cooperative Society of Andhra Pradesh pursuant to our order dated 04.09.2012, we are of the considered view that the orders impugned in these appeals cannot sustain. "
"Further, we find that very many factors which have been brought to our notice, the details of which could be appreciated by this Court, could not be found in the orders impugned in these appeals. "
"We, therefore, set aside the orders impugned in these appeals, while holding that the directions contained in paragraph 40 shall alone govern this case. "
"In the light of our above orders, we find that no orders need be passed in the contempt proceedings initiated in Contempt Petition(C) Nos.302 of 2010 and 251 of 2011 in SLP(C) No.4679 of 2010. "
"The Contempt Petitions are therefore, closed. "
"In this context, we are reminded of the legal maxim 'interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium' which means it is for the general welfare of the State that there be an end to litigation. "
"We, therefore, pass the above directions to put an end to this everlasting litigation at the instance of the cooperative society. "
The appeals are allowed with the above directions. 
No Costs. 
Appeals allowed 
"The appellant who was arraigned as Accused 2 was tried along with five other accused for offences punishable under Sections 498A and 302 read with Ss. 149 and 201 of the IPC by the 1st Additional Sessions Judge, Madhepura. "
"The allegations against the accused, inter alia, were that they subjected one Bindula Devi to cruelty and harassment with a view to coercing her and her other relatives to meet their unlawful demand of property and that on her failure to fulfill their unlawful demand, in furtherance of their common object, they committed her murder and that they caused disappearance of her dead body with an intention to screen themselves from legal punishment. "
Bindula Devi was married to Accused 1 Jaipraksh Yadav. 
The appellant and Accused 3 Shakun Devo Yadav are the brothers of Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav. 
Accused 4 Dani Dutta Yadav is their father and Accused 5 Satya Bhama Devi is their mother. 
Accused 6 Fudai Yadav is brother-in-law of Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav. 
"The prosecution story is reflected in the evidence of Complainant PW- 9 Debu Yadav, the father of Bindula Devi. "
He stated that his daughter Bindula Devi was married to Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav. 
"He further stated that in the marriage one buffalo, one cow and one bullock were given as dowry to the accused as per their demand. "
"However, the accused were not satisfied with that. "
They demanded a wrist watch and a cycle which were given to them. 
Even then they continued to harass and assault Bindula Devi. 
She gave birth to a male child. 
The accused kept Bindula Devi in their house and sent the child to his house so that he would rear the child. 
PW- 9 Debu Yadav further stated that when in Ashwin month he brought Bindula Devi to his house she told him about the ill-treatment meted out to her at her matrimonial home. 
She did not want to go back. 
He tried to pacify her. 
He transferred two kathas of land in her name. 
She then went to her matrimonial home. 
The accused insisted that she should sell the land. 
"As she did not agree to selling of the land, they subjected her to further torture. "
PW-9 Debu Yadav further stated that on a Monday at about 4.00 p.m. Accused 6 Fudai Yadav came to his house and enquired whether Bindula Devi had come there and told him that she had run away from the house. 
He told Accused 6 Fudai Yadav that Bindula Devi would not run away from her house. 
He then proceeded to the house of the accused situated in village Kolhua along with his son Sachindra Yadav and his brother-in-law. 
Accused 6 Fudai Yadav accompanied them for some distance and then left for some other place. 
They reached Kolhua village and found the house of the accused to be empty. 
All the accused had left the house with their belongings. 
Bindula Devi was also not present. 
On enquiry the neighbours told him that because Bindula Devi had refused to transfer the land in the accused's name they had administered poison to her and murdered her. 
He met Sub-Inspector of Police by the river side who recorded his statement. 
A search was conducted. 
The dead body of Bindula Devi was recovered from the river bed. 
Formal FIR of PW-9 Debu Yadav was registered on 31/1/1989 and the investigation was started. 
"The appellant, Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav and Accused 3 Shakun Devo Yadav surrendered before the court on 6/3/1989. "
Accused 4 Dani Dutta Yadav surrendered before the court on 26/8/1989. 
"At the trial, though, the prosecution examined 13 witnesses, it's case rested on the evidence of PW-9 Debu Yadav, father of the deceased and PW-10 Sachindra Yadav, brother of the deceased. "
PWs-2 to 7 turned hostile. 
The accused pleaded not guilty to the charge. 
"They contended that when Bindula Devi went to take bath, she slipped in the water, got drowned and died. "
The trial court convicted the accused section 302 read with section 149 of the IPC and sentenced each of them to suffer life imprisonment. 
They were also convicted under Section 498A of the IPC and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years each. 
They were further convicted and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for seven years each section 201 of the IPC. 
All the substantive sentences were ordered to run concurrently. 
The High Court dismissed their appeal. 
"Hence, this appeal, by special leave, by Accused 2. "
"Mr. Gaurav Agrawal, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the instant case rests on circumstantial evidence. "
"Counsel pointed out that the appellant is the brother of Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav, the husband of Bindula Devi. "
PW-10 Sachindra Yadav stated in his evidence that Accused 1 had separated from his other brothers. 
There is no evidence on record to establish that the appellant was party to any dowry demand or to any ill-treatment meted out to Bindula Devi. 
"Counsel submitted that in cases where apart from husband other members of his family are charged with offences under Sections 304B, 302 and 498A of the IPC and the case rests on circumstantial evidence, unless the circumstantial evidence is of required standard conviction cannot be based on it. "
In this connection he relied on Vithal Tukaram More & Ors. 
"v. State of Maharashtra, (2002) 7 SCC 20 2002 Indlaw SC 1622. "
Counsel submitted that allegations about motive are vague. 
Medical evidence is inconclusive. 
"The prosecution has, therefore, failed to establish its case. "
"In any case, since the appellant was residing separately, in the absence of any clinching evidence establishing his complicity he cannot be convicted. "
"Mr. Gopal Singh, learned counsel for the State of Bihar on the other hand submitted that the evidence on record establishes that all the accused were staying in houses situated in the same courtyard. "
Counsel submitted that evidence of PW-9 Debu Yadav and PW-10 Sachindra Yadav establishes the prosecution case. 
"Pertinently, the accused did not lodge any complaint to the police. "
The fact that they left the house with all their belongings suggests their complicity. 
Counsel submitted that Bindula Devi disappeared from the house of the accused. 
As to how she died in suspicious circumstances was within the knowledge of the accused. 
The burden was shifted to the accused which they have not discharged. 
Adverse inference must be drawn against the accused. 
"In this connection, counsel relied on Balaram Prasad Agrawal v. State of Bihar & Ors, (1997) 9 SCC 338 1996 Indlaw SC 1761. "
"Counsel submitted that appeal be, therefore, dismissed. "
We have already referred to the evidence of father of Bindula Devi PW- 9 Debu Yadav. 
He has given a graphic account of the harassment and ill- treatment meted out to the deceased by the accused. 
"They were not happy with a bullock, a cow and a buffalo which were given as dowry. "
They asked for a watch and a cycle. 
That was also given. 
They asked for more. 
PW-9 Debu Yadav transferred 2 kathas of land to Bindula Devi. 
The accused wanted to sell it or wanted it to be transferred in their names and since Bindula Devi did not agree to that they continued to torture her. 
"Her son was sent to her father so that he would be brought up by him, but she was kept in the matrimonial house obviously to work. "
PW-10 Sachindra Yadav the brother of Bindula Devi has corroborated his father. 
"It is distressing to note that all the other witnesses, that is PW-2 to PW-7 turned hostile. "
"In the facts of this case, it is indeed a pointer to the guilt of the accused. "
They won over the prosecution witnesses. 
We note with some anguish the following sentences uttered by PW-9 Debu Yadav in his cross-examination probably as an answer to the usual question about there being no independent witness to depose about cruelty. 
"He stated ""whenever my daughter visited my house, she used to complain that she is being tortured and assaulted there. "
"Who else can be a witness to this fact?"" Having perused the evidence of PWs-9 and 10 we have no manner of doubt that Bindula Devi was subjected to cruelty and harassment for dowry by the accused. "
Evidence of these witnesses is straightforward and honest. 
There is no exaggeration. 
In the cross-examination their evidence has not suffered any dent. 
Implicit reliance can be placed on them. 
"It is submitted that the appellant had separated from Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav and, hence, he cannot be a party to the alleged acts of cruelty of the other accused. "
We find no substance in this submission. 
"Though, PW-10 Sachindra Yadav stated that Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav had separated from his brothers after marriage, he has clarified that all the brothers have their houses in a common courtyard. "
PW-9 Debu Yadav has specifically named the appellant as a person who demanded cattle. 
He has stated that the accused were not satisfied with the cattle given by him. 
They demanded more dowry. 
They used to harass and assault Bindula Devi. 
"He stated that when he went to the house of the accused after receiving information that she had left their house, he found the house to be empty. "
All the accused had absconded. 
They had taken their belongings with them. 
This is confirmed by PW-13 Surendra Rai the Investigating Officer. 
He stated that when he went to the house of the accused after receiving information about disappearance of Bindula Devi he found the house completely empty. 
Even the household articles and food grains were missing. 
The accused were not present. 
No member of their family was present. 
Bindula Devi was also not present. 
These circumstances persuade us to reject the submission that the appellant did not join the other accused in treating Bindula Devi with cruelty. 
The conviction and sentence of the appellant under Section 498A of the IPC is therefore perfectly justified. 
We now come to the death of Bindula Devi. 
PW-9 Debu Yadav and PW-10 Schindra Yadav stated that dead body of Bindula Devi was recovered from the river bed. 
"The Investigating Officer PW-13 Surendra Rai stated that after recording the FIR of PW-9 Debu Yadav, he inspected the house of Accused 1 Jaiprakash Yadav. "
The dead body of Bindula Devi was found lying 600 yards away from the house of the accused. 
"It was lying in one foot deep water, close to the southern bank of the river, near a ferry. "
The ferry was situated adjacent to the maize field of Hazari Mandal. 
He took it out and prepared inquest report. 
"He further stated that one Vinod stated that on 29/1/1989, the accused had a meeting. "
"On 30/1/1989, they left for some other place and in the evening it was revealed that they had killed Bindula Devi by poisoning her and had thrown her dead body at the ferry. "
"The Investigating Officer further stated that Vinod, Parmeshvari Yadav, Brij Bihari Yadav also confirmed this fact. "
All these persons turned hostile in the court. 
PW-12 Dr. Arun Kumar Mandal did the post-mortem on the dead body of Bindula Devi. 
Following are his observations: 
(1) Epistaxis from both nostrils. 
(2) Blood mixed with froth from mouth. 
"(3) Both eye balls congested, cornea hazy. "
(4) Face congested and cyanosed. 
(5) Skin of both hands and feet were corrugated. 
On opening of skull all the blood vessels were congested in the maninges and brain matter. 
"In the chest both the lungs were found congested, frothy and spongy and on cutting blood stains froth found in segments. "
In the heart both chambers were found full. 
In the stomach semi-digested food about 4 ounces with blood mixed. 
In the small intestine-gas and solid facees. 
In the large intestine-gas and solid facees. 
In the case of kidneys both were found congested. 
Liver an spleen were also found congested. 
"Uterus contained about full term dead male baby."" "
PW-12 Dr. Arun Kumar Mandal opined that the cause of death was asphaxia due to drowning. 
"He stated that in cases of drowning, if immediate death is caused, then, there will be negligible quantum of water in the stomach. "
He further stated that death may be caused even in one foot deep water if the victim is kept in water with his neck pressed in sleeping position. 
It may be stated here that report of the viscera examination is not on record. 
Dr. Mandal has admitted that he did not know the result of viscera examination. 
He added that there were no injuries on the person of the deceased. 
"In our opinion, the evidence of the father and the brother of Bindula Devi and other attendant circumstances such as strong motive; the fact that the accused did not lodge any complaint about missing of Bindula Devi; that Accused 6 Fudai Yadav went to the house of PW-9 Debu Yadav to enquire about Bindula Devi and then suddenly deserted PWs 9 and 10 when they were going to the house of the accused, that all the accused absconded from their house with their belongings and that the house was completely empty, lead to an irresistible conclusion that the accused were responsible for the death of Bindula Devi. "
"It is submitted that since there were no injuries on the dead body of Bindula Devi, it would be wrong to conclude that Bindula Devi was kept in water in a sleeping position with her neck pressed as suggested by the doctor. "
The prosecution story that the accused caused her death must therefore be rejected. 
"Medical evidence, it is argued, does not support the prosecution case. "
"In our opinion, the prosecution having established that the accused treated the deceased with cruelty and that they subjected her to harassment for dowry, the accused ought to have disclosed the facts which were in their personal and special knowledge to disprove the prosecution case that they murdered Bindula Devi. "
section 106 of the Evidence Act covers such a situation. 
The burden which had shifted to the accused was not discharged by them. 
"In this connection, we may usefully refer to the judgment of this Court in Shambhu Nath Mehra v. State of Ajmer, AIR 1956 SC 404 1956 Indlaw SC 81 where this Court explained how section 101 and section 106 of the Evidence Act operate. "
Relevant portion of the said judgment reads thus: 
"(10) section 106 is an exception to section 101. 	Precedent
section 101 lays down the general rule about the burden of proof. 	Precedent
'Whoever desires any Court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts, must prove that those facts exist'. 	Precedent
Illustration (a) says - 	Precedent
'A desires a Court to give judgment that B shall be punished for a crime which A says B has committed. 	Precedent
A must prove that B has committed the crime'. 	Precedent
(11) This lays down the general rule that in a criminal case, the burden of proof is on the prosecution and section 106 is certainly not intended to relieve it of that duty. 	Ratio of the decision
On the contrary, it is designed to meet certain exceptional cases in which it would be impossible, or at any rate disproportionately difficult, for the prosecution to establish facts which are 'especially' within the knowledge of the accused and which he could prove without difficulty or inconvenience. "
"In Balram Prasad Agrawal v. State of Bihar, (1997) 9 SCC 338 1996 Indlaw SC 1761, the prosecution had established the cruel conduct of the accused i.e. her husband and members of his family and the sufferings undergone by the deceased at their hands. "
The unbearable conduct of the accused ultimately resulted in her death by drowning in the well in the courtyard of the accused's house. 
This Court observed that what happened on the fateful night and what led to the deceased's falling in the well was wholly within the personal and special knowledge of the accused. 
But they kept mum on this aspect. 
This Court observed that it is true that the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. 
"But once the prosecution is found to have shown that the accused were guilty of persistent conduct of cruelty qua the deceased spread over years as was well established from the unshaken testimony of father of the deceased, the facts which were in the personal knowledge of the accused who were present in the house on that fateful night could have been revealed by them to disprove the prosecution case. "
This Court observed that the accused had not discharged the burden which had shifted to them under section 106 of the Evidence Act. 
"While coming to this conclusion, this Court relied on Shambhu Nath Mehra. "
"In the present case, the deceased was admittedly in the custody of the accused. "
She disappeared from their house. 
As to how her dead body was found in the river was within their special and personal knowledge. 
They could have revealed the facts to disprove the prosecution case that they had killed Bindula Devi. 
They failed to discharge the burden which had shifted to them under section 106 of the Evidence Act. 
The prosecution is not expected to give the exact manner in which the deceased was killed. 
Adverse inference needs to be drawn against the accused as they failed to explain how the deceased was found dead in the river in one foot deep water. 
"Pertinently, the post-mortem notes do not indicate presence of huge amount of water in the dead body. "
"According to PW-12 Dr. Mandal, in a case of drowning, if immediate death is caused, then, there will be negligible quantum of water in the stomach. "
"From the evidence of PW-12 Dr. Mandal, it appears that the death of Bindula Devi occurred immediately after she was drowned in the water because there was not much water in her stomach. "
It is also pertinent to note that Bindula Devi was pregnant. 
Her uterus contained full term dead male baby. 
"She could not have, therefore, offered any resistance. "
"It appears that, therefore, there were no injuries on the dead body. "
The whole operation appears to have been done swiftly and skillfully. 
"But in any case, as stated hereinabove, it is not for the prosecution to explain in what manner Bindula Devi was done to death by the accused because Bindula Devi was staying in the house of the accused prior to the occurrence and she disappeared from that house. "
All the circumstances leading to her unnatural death were within the special and personal knowledge of the accused which they chose not to disclose. 
"Instead, they gave a totally false explanation that when Bindula Devi had gone for bath, she slipped, got drowned in the water and died. "
This story is palpably false. 
The false explanation offered by the accused further strengthens the prosecution case as it becomes an additional link in the chain of circumstances. 
"It is true that in Vithal Tukaram More this Court has held that in a case where other members of the husband's family are charged with offences under Sections 304B, 302 and 498A of the IPC and the case rests on circumstantial evidence, the circumstantial evidence must be of required standard if conviction has to be based on it. "
We are of the considered opinion that the evidence adduced by the prosecution in this case is of required standard. 
"No other inference, except that of the guilt of the accused, is possible on the basis of the evidence on record. "
The established facts are consistent only with the hypothesis of their guilt and inconsistent with their innocence. 
"The appeal, therefore, deserves to be dismissed. "
"Before we part, we must refer to a very vital aspect of this case. "
"PW-9 Debu Yadav, the father of Bindula Devi stated that the neighbours told him that Bindula Devi was poisoned by the accused. "
"PW-10 Sachindra Yadav, brother of Bindula Devi has also stated so. "
"PW-13 Surendra Rai, the Investigating Officer went a step further. "
"He stated that Vinod Yadav, Shiv Pujan Ram, Vinod Kumar Mehta, Parmeshwar Yadav and Braj Bihari Yadav told him that the accused had killed Bindula Devi by poisoning her; that they had concealed the dead body in the river and had run away. "
"Unfortunately, these witnesses turned hostile. "
But the fact remains that the prosecution had come out with a case of poisoning. 
"It was, therefore, necessary for the prosecution to get the viscera examined from Forensic Science Laboratory (""the FSL""). "
"The trial court has observed that the Investigating Officer had filed a petition on 19/4/1988 requesting the doctor to send the viscera for chemical analysis to the FSL, Patna. "
Post-mortem notes mention that viscera was protected for future needs. 
This is also stated by PW-12 Dr. Mandal. 
"Dr. Mandal has, however, added that he did not know the result of viscera examination. "
"From the evidence of the Investigating Officer, PW-13 Surendra Rai, it appears that the doctor did not send the viscera to the FSL. "
"When he was questioned about the viscera report, the Investigating Officer stated in the cross-examination that a letter had been sent to the doctor about viscera examination. "
"He further stated that he did not make any complaint against the doctor to the senior officers, but, informed his officer through diary. "
We are of the opinion that the doctor ought to have sent the viscera to the FSL when he was requested to do so. 
"On his failure to do so, the Investigating Officer should have informed his superior officer and taken steps to ensure that viscera is sent to the FSL rather than just making a diary entry. "
Such a supine indifference has a disastrous effect on the criminal justice administration system. 
"We are aware that in some cases where there is other clinching evidence on record to establish the case of poisoning, this Court has proceeded to convict the accused even in the absence of viscera report. "
"In Bhupendra v. State of Madhya Pradesh, 2013 (13) SCALE 52 2013 Indlaw SC 736 this Court was concerned with a case where the viscera report was not on record, but, there was enough evidence of poisoning. "
The accused was charged under Sections 304-B and 306 of the IPC. 
"Drawing support from the presumptions under Sections 113B and 113A of the Evidence Act, 1872 and, after referring to relevant judgments on the point, this Court held that death of the deceased was caused by poisoning. "
The relevant observation of this Court could be quoted. 
"These decisions clearly bring out that a chemical examination of the viscera is not mandatory in every case of a dowry death; even when a viscera report is sought for, its absence is not necessarily fatal to the case of the prosecution when an unnatural death punishable under Section 304-B of the IPC or section 306 of the IPC takes place; in a case of an unnatural death inviting Section 304-B of the IPC (read with the presumption under Section 113-B of the Evidence Act, 1872) or section 306 of the IPC (read with the presumption under Section 113-A of the Evidence Act, 1872) as long as there is evidence of poisoning, identification of the poison may not be absolutely necessary."" "
"In Chhotan Sao & Another v. State of Bihar, 2013 (15) SCALE 338 2013 Indlaw SC 851 this Court was dealing with a case involving Sections 304-B and 498A of the IPC. "
The allegations were that the deceased was murdered by poisoning her. 
The viscera report was not on record. 
There was no other evidence on record to establish that the deceased was poisoned. 
This Court distinguished the case before it from the facts of Bhupendra and while acquitting the accused of the charge under Section 304-B of the IPC made the following pertinent observations: 
"Before parting with the appeal, we wish to place on record our anguish regarding the inadequacy of investigation, the failure to discharge the responsibility on the part of the public prosecutor and the Magistrate who took cognizance of the offence under Section 304-B. The Investigating Officer who submitted the charge sheet ought not to have done it without securing the viscera report from the forensic lab and placing it before the Court. "
"Having regard to the nature of the crime, it is a very vital document more particularly in the absence of any direct evidence regarding the consumption of poison by the deceased Babita Devi. "
Equally the public prosecutor failed in his responsibility to guide the investigating officer in that regard. 
"Coming to the magistrate who committed the matter to the Sessions Court, he failed to apply his mind and mechanically committed the matter for trial. "
Public prosecutors and judicial officers owe a greater responsibility to ensure compliance with law in a criminal case. 
Any lapse on their part such as the one which occurred in the instant case is bound to jeopardize the prosecution case resulting in avoidable acquittals. 
"Inefficiency and callousness on their part is bound to shake the faith of the society in the system of administration of criminal justice in this country which, in our opinion, has reached considerably lower level than desirable."" "
"We must note that this is the third case which this Court has noticed in a short span of two months where, in a case of suspected poisoning, viscera report is not brought on record. "
We express our extreme displeasure about the way in which such serious cases are dealt with. 
We wonder whether these lapses are the result of inadvertence or they are a calculated move to frustrate the prosecution. 
"Though the FSL report is not mandatory in all cases, in cases where poisoning is suspected, it would be advisable and in the interest of justice to ensure that the viscera is sent to the FSL and the FSL report is obtained. "
This is because not in all cases there is adequate strong other evidence on record to prove that the deceased was administered poison by the accused. 
"In a criminal trial the Investigating Officer, the Prosecutor and the Court play a very important role. "
The court's prime duty is to find out the truth. 
"The Investigating Officer, the Prosecutor and the Courts must work in sync and ensure that the guilty are punished by bringing on record adequate credible legal evidence. "
"If the Investigating Officer stumbles, the Prosecutor must pull him up and take necessary steps to rectify the lacunae. "
"The Criminal Court must be alert, it must oversee their actions and, in case, it suspects foul play, it must use its vast powers and frustrate any attempt to set at naught a genuine prosecution. "
"Perhaps, the instant case would have been further strengthened had the viscera been sent to the FSL and the FSL report was on record. "
"These scientific tests are of vital importance to a criminal case, particularly when the witnesses are increasingly showing a tendency to turn hostile. "
In the instant case all those witnesses who spoke about poisoning turned hostile. 
"Had the viscera report been on record and the case of poisoning was true, the prosecution would have been on still firmer grounds. "
"Having noticed that, in several cases where poisoning is suspected, the prosecuting agencies are not taking steps to obtain viscera report, we feel it necessary to issue certain directions in that behalf. "
"We direct that in cases where poisoning is suspected, immediately after the post- mortem, the viscera should be sent to the FSL. "
"The prosecuting agencies should ensure that the viscera is, in fact, sent to the FSL for examination and the FSL should ensure that the viscera is examined immediately and report is sent to the investigating agencies/courts post haste. "
"If the viscera report is not received, the concerned court must ask for explanation and must summon the concerned officer of the FSL to give an explanation as to why the viscera report is not forwarded to the investigating agency/court. "
The criminal court must ensure that it is brought on record. 
We have examined the merits of the case and held that the appeal deserves to be dismissed. 
"In the circumstances, the appeal is dismissed. "
"A copy of this order be sent to the Registrar Generals of all the High Courts with a direction to circulate the same to all subordinate Criminal Courts; to the Director of Prosecution, to the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, to the Secretary, Home Department and to the Director, Forensic Science Laboratory within the jurisdiction of the respective High Courts. "

"On 12.11.1951, the Uttar Pradesh Official Language Act, 1951 (U.P. Act No.XXVI of 1951) (for short, '1951 Act') was published in Gazette Extraordinary and came into force. "

Ordinance No.44 of 1983, filed another writ petition before the Allahabad High Court, Lucknow Bench challenging the 1989 Amendment Act and Notification dated 07.10.1989. "
"This writ petition was heard by the Division Bench comprising of S.N. Sahay and D.K. Trivedi, JJ. "
"S.N. Sahay, J. in his judgment held that the 1989 Amendment Act and the notification impugned in the writ petition were ultra vires and liable to be struck down. "
"He, however, observed that the State Legislature shall not be precluded from making any law in future with respect to Urdu in accordance with the provisions of articles 345 and 347 of the Constitution. "
"D.K. Trivedi, J., on the other hand, did not concur with the view of S.N. Sahay, J. He, in his separate judgment, held that the 1989 Amendment Act and the notification impugned in the writ petition did not suffer from the Constitutional vice and the writ petition was liable to be dismissed. "
"In view of the difference of opinion between the Members of the Bench, the Bench directed the papers to be laid before the Chief Justice of the High Court for referring the following questions to a third Judge for his opinion: "
Whether the impugned enactment can be said to be a valid piece of legislation within the meaning of article 345 of the Constitution? 
Whether the impugned notification suffers from the vice of excessive delegation ? 
Whether the impugned enactment and the impugned notification are valid and Constitutional or ultra vires? 
"The Chief Justice of the High Court then referred the matter to the third Judge, Brijesh Kumar, J. (as His Lordship then was) for answer to the above questions. "
"Brijesh Kumar, J. answered the questions referred to him as follows: "
"(1) That while enacting law to officially recognise a second language for use in the State, the State Legislature shall have to consider the provisions of articles 345 and 347 of the Constitution by reading them together; the impugned enactment is, however, valid piece of legislation in view of the judgment of the Division Bench in Writ Petition No. 285/84. "
(2) The impugned enactment does not suffer from the vice of excessive delegation. 
"(3) In view of the answers given on questions No. (1) and (2), I find that the impugned enactment as well as the notification are valid and Constitutional. "
"In light of the answers given by the third Judge, the matter was placed before the Division Bench for appropriate orders on the writ petition. "
The Division Bench by its order dated 16.08.1996 dismissed the writ petition holding as follows: 
"In view of the learned third Judge, Hon'ble Brijesh Kumar, J., the U.P. Official Language (Amendment ) Act, I989 (U.P. Act No.28 of 1989) adding section 3 in the U.P. Official Language Act, 1951 is held to be intra vires. "
It is further heId that the impugned enactment does not suffer from the vice of excessive delegation. 
The impugned enactment as well as the notification are held valid and Constitutional. 
"In the result, the writ petition fails and is dismissed. "
No order as to costs. 
"Aggrieved by the judgment and order of the Allahabad High Court dated 16.08.1996, the present appellant filed special leave petition. "
Leave was granted by this Court on 27.01.1997. 
"On 02.09.2003, the appeal was listed for hearing before a 2- Judge Bench of this Court. "
"The Bench felt that having regard to the nature of controversy and the important question of law arising in the matter, it was appropriate that matter should be heard by a Bench of 3-Judges. "
It was then that the matter was listed before the 3-Judge Bench on 29.10.2003. 
"On that day, the Court was of the opinion that the appeal needed to be heard by a Bench of 5-Judges as it involves substantial question of law as to the interpretation of articles 345 and 347 of the Constitution. "
This is how the appeal has come up before us.

"
It is apposite here to briefly notice the views of prominent authors with regard to Part XVII of the Constitution. 
It is commonly believed that the keenest controversy in the Constituent Assembly was in regard to the official language. 
"Shri B. Shiva Rao (The Project Committee Chairman) in ""The Framing of India's Constitution - A Study"" records: "
"This issue produced so much heat and gave rise to such violent feelings that it was felt necessary from the outset to keep it out of direct discussion in the Assembly. 	Ratio of the decision
The leaders made every effort to settle it on the basis of general accord, but often it seemed as though a settlement might not be possible. 	Ratio of the decision
It was not until towards the end of the Constitution making process that some kind of agreement could be reached. "
"In Chapter 26 of this volume, it is further recorded : "
"Feelings on the language issue developed formidably almost from the opening of the Constituent Assembly. 	Ratio of the decision
It was, however, not the Hindi versus Urdu or Hindi versus Hindustani controversy that was raised at this time; there was general agreement that Hindustani might be the name for the national language. 	Ratio of the decision
When the question of the setting up of a committee on the rules of procedure was discussed, R. V. Dhulekar moved an amendment proposing that the committee should frame rules in Hindustani and not in English. 	Ratio of the decision
The Chairman requested him to speak in English, as many members could not understand Hindustani; but Dhulekar not only insisted on speaking in Hindustani but made the remark that those who did not know Hindustani had no right to stay in India and were not worthy to be members of the Assembly. 	Ratio of the decision
The Chairman cut the discussion short by ruling the amendment out of order and prohibiting all further discussion'; but the issue was revived when the report of the committee came up for discussion. 	Ratio of the decision
The committee recommended that in the Assembly business should be transacted in Hindustani (Hindi or Urdu) or English, but the Chairman was permitted to allow any member unacquainted with these languages to. 	Ratio of the decision
address the Assembly in his mother tongue. 	Ratio of the decision
The official records of the Assembly were to be kept in Urdu, Hindi and English. "
In Vol. 
"IV of the Framing of India's Constitution - Select Documents, Chapter 13 highlights the provisions relating to Official Language. "
"It is stated therein that neither the draft Constitution prepared by the Constitutional Adviser nor the version as settled by the Drafting Committee contained any provisions relating to official language, but they contained provisions as to the language or the languages to be used in the Union Parliament and the State Legislatures. "
The language issue figured prominently during the general discussion on the Draft Constitution; and the sharp differences of opinion which developed in the course of the debate revealed the extent of feeling which the question had engendered. 
"Towards the end of August, 1949, Munshi and Gopalaswami Ayyangar prepared detailed draft compromise provisions for inclusion in the Draft Constitution. "
"The draft provisions on the official language prepared by Munshi and Gopalaswami Ayyangar as revised by the Drafting Committee had four chapters, Language of the Union, Regional languages, Language of Supreme Court and High Courts etc. "
and Special Directive. 
"Granville Austin in the Indian Constitution - Cornerstone of a Nation, has described Munshi-Ayyangar formula as half-hearted compromise. "
He says that it was a compromise between opinions which were not easily reconcilable. 
"There were two basic principles behind the formula, one ""we should select one of the languages in India as the common language of the whole of India"". "
"The second principle was ""that the numerals to be used for all official Union purposes should be what have been described as the all- India forms of Indian numerals. "
" The members of the Assembly voted for the Munshi-Ayyangar formula. 	Ratio of the decision
H. M. Seervai in Constitutional Law of India - A Critical Commentary (Fourth Edition) [] has also given a brief historical account of the language issue that erupted in the course of discussion on the Draft Constitution. 	Ratio of the decision
H. M. Seervai states that having regard to the place given to the Union in our Constitution, the importance of the official language of the Union cannot be overrated. 	Ratio of the decision
Drawing the distinction between English and Hindi, on the one hand, and other languages mentioned in Schedule VIII, on the other hand, the learned author says: 	Ratio of the decision
English was and is a de facto medium of instruction in various Universities. 	Ratio of the decision
The Constitution and the Official Languages Act have continued its use for official purposes of the Union of India. 	Ratio of the decision
Therefore, English stands in a class by itself, because of historical reasons and because of express Constitutional and legislative provisions. 	Ratio of the decision
Hindi also occupies a position by itself. 	Ratio of the decision
It is the official language of the Union of India and the Constitution contemplates that it should gradually replace English. 	Ratio of the decision
Therefore, Hindi is also in a class by itself. 	Ratio of the decision
But the other languages mentioned in Sch. 	Ratio of the decision
VIII stand on a different footing. 	Ratio of the decision
The retention of English as a medium is justified and the substitution of English by Hindi can be justified for reasons mentioned above. 	Ratio of the decision
But the substitution of any other regional language for English cannot be justified because there would be other languages spoken by large groups of people which are capable of being the media of instruction in Universities. 	Ratio of the decision
Since there are large numbers of people in the city whose mother tongue is Marathi, Gujarati, Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam, and Urdu, it would be difficult to justify the selection of one or more of these languages as a medium of instruction to the exclusion of the others, if the principle of selection is that University education should be in the mother tongue. 	Ratio of the decision
[] 23.2 The provisions of our Constitution relating to language have raised no serious questions of legal interpretation, but they have raised serious political problems. 	Ratio of the decision
It is outside the scope of this work to describe in detail the various phases of the controversy about language which resulted in the enactment of Part XVII of our Constitution. 	Ratio of the decision
Nor is it necessary to do so, for a well documented and vivid account of the forces at play has been given by Austin in his chapter entitled Language and the Constitution - the Half-hearted Compromise"". "
"The chapter repays study, but its effect may be stated thus: in his struggle for political freedom, Mahatma Gandhi raised the question of a national language. "
"He described it at times as Hindi, and at times as Hindustani, but he understood by both a language which was neither Sanskritised Hindi nor Persianised Urdu, but a happy blend of both, written either in the Devanagari or the Persian script. "
However the question of language did not receive much attention till it was forced upon the Constituent Assembly. 
On political and psychological grounds there was a general demand for a national language. 
But difficulties became apparent when that demand had to be translated into Constitutional provisions. 
"The need for unity among the Indian people was undisputed, and English had supplied that basic unity by uniting the people of the North, whose language was derived from Sanskrit or Persian, and the people of the South speaking Dravidian languages which were not so derived. "
"Again, administration at the higher levels, higher education, the legislature, the law courts, and the professions, all used English, and the question was which language should take the place of English and when? Till the partition of India, Hindustani in both the Devanagari and the Persian script held the field. "
"With the partition of India the cause of Hindustani was lost, though Mahatma Gandhi held that the Indian National Congress ought to stand for a broad outlook and should stand firm on a language which was spoken by the largest group of people. "
"Though Hindi was selected as the official language, it could not be described as the national language, for, it was not the language generally spoken in all parts of India, and though spoken by the largest single group of people, that group did not constitute the majority of people in India. "
"Besides, there were regional languages such as Bengali in Bengal, Tamil in Madras, Marathi and Gujarati in the erstwhile State of Bombay which were spoken by large populations and it was claimed for those languages that they were more developed than Hindi. "
Hindi was therefore described as the official language. 
"In the Constituent Assembly, the protagonists of Hindi were prepared to abandon the basis of consensus on which the Assembly had functioned; but their extreme methods provoked a reaction and some who had supported them earlier withdrew their support. "
"The leaders of the Congress party, who formed the government of the day, counselled moderation, for they were brought in close contact with the difficulties involved in making the transition from English to an Indian language. "
It appeared at one stage that the unity which had existed in the Constituent Assembly would break down on the provisions relating to language. 
"at the last moment, a compromise formula called the ""Munshi-Ayyangar formula"" was evolved and was accepted without dissent. "
"It was a half-hearted compromise, for it gave to neither party what it wanted. "
"Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru told the Constituent Assembly, that he would not have accepted Hindi as. "
"the official language if express provision had not been made that Hindi did not exclude Hindustani, that it was not to be the language of a learned coterie and that Hindi was to be based on the composite culture of India assimilating words from all languages. "
"A period of 15 years was provided during which English was to continue but this was a flexible limit, for Parliament could extend it. "
"The battle over numerals was settled in favour of ""the international form of Indian numerals"" - a euphemism for Arabic numerals, with a proviso that after 15 years Parliament might by law provide for the use of the Devanagari form of numerals for such purposes as may be specified. "
"Acharya Dr. Durga Das Basu, in his commentary on the Constitution of India, Volume 9, 2011 while dealing with Part XVII under the sub-title ""Need for a National Language"" observes that the Constitution makers failed to declare one language as the national language of India and what has been provided in the Constitution is mainly a compromise between the diverse claims [$2]. "
"Dr. Basu then observes that what has been provided in the Constitution is not a national language but - (a) an ""official language"" for the Union (Articles 343-344); (b) regional official languages for the States (Articles 345-347); and (c) official language (a) for purposes of proceedings in the Supreme Court and High Courts and (b) for Bills, Acts, Ordinances, Regulations, bye-laws at the Union and State level. "
"Dr. Basu in his treatise quotes the Constitutional Law of India by T.K. Tope (3rd Edition, 2010 at pp. "
"1113-1114), wherein the author has stated that Hindi has not been accepted as the national language by the Constitution; the Constitution has not laid down any language as the national language. "
"[$2] (Reference is made to Granville Austin, the Indian Constitution -Cornerstone of a Nation, Ninth Impression, 2005, Pg. 266) "
"Now, it is time to turn to the two Articles, articles 345 and 347, which have fallen for consideration on the issue, whether it is Constitutional for the U.P. Legislative Assembly to declare Urdu as the second official language through the 1989 Amendment Act once it has declared Hindi as the official language in 1951 under article 345 of the Constitution of India. "
"The submission by Mr. Shyam Divan, learned senior counsel for the appellant, is that having regard to the special Constitutional status of the Hindi language, where the Legislature of a State by law adopts Hindi as the official language, two things necessarily follow (one) the State Legislature is precluded from de-recognising Hindi as an official language and (two) the State Legislature is precluded from adopting any other official language. "
The argument of the learned senior counsel for the appellant is founded on the premise that Part XVII of the Constitution constitutes complete scheme with regard to official language. 
"The two key features of Part XVII, according to learned senior counsel, are: a special status to the Hindi language and a special role of balancing entrusted to the President on the sensitive and potentially divisive issue of language. "
"What logically follows from the argument of Mr. Shyam Divan is that the text of article 345 gives two options to the State Legislature, one, adoption of any one or more of the languages in use in the State (Option 1) and the other, Hindi (Option 2) and once Option 2 is exercised, the power of the State Legislature gets exhausted. "
"If the argument of Mr. Shyam Divan is accepted, it would mean that the use of the word ""or"" signifies that Option 1 would be available to the Legislature of State only if it does not go in for Option 2. "
"Once the State Legislature has exercised Option 2, and adopted Hindi as the language to be used for all or any of the official purposes of the State, it cannot go down the route of Option 1. "
We find it difficult to accept the submission of learned senior counsel. 
"Merely because Hindi is mentioned explicitly or separately and it is adopted as official language by the State, we do not think that the Constitution forecloses the State Legislature's option to adopt any other language in use in the State as official language. "
"Nothing in Article 345, in our view, bars declaring one or more of the languages in use in the State, in addition to Hindi, as the second official language. "
This can only be at the cost of distorting the provision contained in article 345. 
"The significance of the word ""or"" occurring before ""Hindi"" is to dispense with the requirement of Hindi being ""in use"", while the requirement of being ""in use"" for any other language to be declared official language has to be satisfied for exercise of power by the State Legislature under article 345. "
Dispensing this requirement for Hindi was meant to absorb the adoption of Hindi across States. 
This cannot be taken to mean that the particular State Legislature must sacrifice its power in promoting other languages within the State. 
The purpose of using Hindi separately in article 345 is to facilitate adoption of Hindi across the States whether or not Hindi is in use in a particular State. 
Any other construction to article 345 would be unduly interfering with the language compromise adopted by the Constitution. 
Part XVII of the Constitution as its scheme suggests is accommodative. 
"After all, language policies are constructs and they change over time. "
"(Schiffman, Harold. ""Language policy and linguistic culture"". "
An introduction to language policy: Theory and method (2006) : 111-125) 
The plain language of article 345 which empowers the State Legislature to make law for adoption of one or more of the languages in use in the State leaves no manner of doubt that such power may be exercised by the State Legislature from time to time. 
A different intention does not appear from the plain language of article 345. 
We do not find any indication that the power can be exercised by the State Legislature only once and that power gets exhausted if the State Legislature adopts Hindi as the official language of the State. 
"In our view, the State Legislature is at liberty to exercise its discretion under article 345 from time to time for specified purpose. "
"It does not appear to us that Hindi once adopted as official language of the State in exercise of its power by State Legislature under Article 345, the State Legislature ceases to have any law making power under article 345. "
The judgment of this Court in Sri Nasiruddin v. State Transport Appellate Tribunal; [(1975) 2 SCC 671 1975 Indlaw SC 231] has no application for the purpose of construction of article 345. 
"We shall deal with the expression ""subject to"" a little later but suffice it to say here that there are many State Legislatures who have adopted other officially recognized language(s) in addition to Hindi such as Bihar, Haryana, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand. "
Delhi has also adopted Punjabi and Urdu as other officially recognized languages in addition to Hindi. 
"Obviously, this would not have been possible but for the Constitutional permissibility. "
"The position that Hindi has been mentioned separately in article 345 in the context of the preceding expression ""adopt any one or more of the languages in use in the State"" is to promote and spread Hindi in terms of article 351 though it may not be spoken or used by the people in the State. "
article 345 enables the State Legislature to adopt any number of languages which are in use in the State for all or any of the official purposes of the State. 
"It is not necessary that there must be demand made on that behalf to the State Government or if there is demand, the State Legislature cannot make law adopting a language in use in the State as second official language. "
This is one of the distinguishing features between articles 345 and 347. 
If Hindi is in use in a particular State then it does not foreclose the State's power or discretion to adopt any language other than Hindi as the official language provided such language is 'in use' in that State. 
"The use of the word ""may"" in article 345 is not without significance. "
It indicates that State has discretion in adopting the language or languages in use in the State and so also Hindi. 
Such discretion can be exercised any number of times by the State Legislature as it deems proper. 
The only restriction to such legislative power is in article 347 in a given situation which we shall explain after some more discussion. 
"Part XVII of the Constitution titled ""official language"", Mr. Shyam Divan, learned senior counsel argues, is a self-contained part of the Constitution akin to a complete Code. "
His submission is that the provisions in Part XVII constitute a complete scheme with respect to official language. 
We are in agreement with the learned senior counsel to this extent. 
He is also right in his submission that Hindi language has a special status and particularly in Part XVII. 
"In this regard, reference to articles 343(1), 344(2)(a), 345, 346 proviso, 348(2) and 351 has been rightly made. "
"The above provisions in the Constitution, in our view, prescribe larger Constitutional charter for Hindi but this position in no way leads to the conclusion suggested by the learned senior counsel for the appellant that where the Legislature of a State by law adopts Hindi as the official language, the State Legislature is precluded from adopting any other official language. "
"As noted earlier, nothing in article 345 bars adopting any other official language in use in the State, in addition to Hindi, as the second official language. "
"It is true that Part XVII specifies the role of the President (or for that matter, 'Union Government') under numerous provisions. "
The President may respond to a demand for an additional official language where the requirements of article 347 are fulfilled. 
"Before directing that a particular language shall also be officially recognized throughout a State or any part of the State for such purpose as the President may specify, the President must be satisfied that ""a substantial portion of the population of a State desire the use of any language spoken by them to be recognized by that State"". "
Article 350B provides a machinery by which the President may make an assessment with respect to demand of linguistic minorities. 
"However, we are not persuaded to accept the argument of the learned senior counsel for the appellant that arrangement in Part XVII of the Constitution seeks to ensure that the States do not yield to demands for multiple official languages sequentially and this power is reserved exclusively with the President (Union Executive). "
"The expression ""subject to the provisions of articles 346 and 347"" occurring in article 345 does not make article 345 subordinate to articles 346 and 347 as suggested by the learned senior counsel. "
"The effect of the expression ""subject to........"" is that any law made by the Legislature of the State is subject to directions existing, if any, issued by the President under article 347 when the State Legislature exercises its power under article 345. "
"Once the direction is issued by the President under Article 347, it is not open to the State Legislature to tinker with such direction in any manner. "
"In other words, the exercise of power by the State Legislature should not be in conflict in any manner with the directions that may have been issued by the President article 347. "
The plenary power of the State under article 345 is limited to this extent only. 
"Except to the limited extent as noted above, it is not correct to say that power of the State Legislature under article 345 is subordinate or servient to article 347. "
"Part XVII must be read as a whole and, in our view, articles 345 and 347 should be construed so as to make it consistent with federal structure and so also the other provisions of this Chapter. "
"The law making power of the State Legislature under article 345 is restricted by virtue of the expression ""subject to......"" against the direction issued by the President under article 347 occupying the field. "
"Absent such direction, the State Legislature is not prevented in any manner in exercising its power under article 345. "
"We have, thus, no hesitation in holding that in the absence of direction issued by the President under article 347 of the Constitution, there is no restriction, restraint or impediment for the State Legislature in adopting one of the languages in use in the State as an official language under article 345 of the Constitution of India. "
"As seen above, article 345 deals with the power of the State Legislature while article 347 refers to the power of the President. "
These two provisions prescribe a different procedure for making law or issuing directions for recognising a language as official language. 
"The requirement, ""a substantial portion of the population of a State desire the use of any language spoken by them to be recognized by that State"" in article 347 is not a requirement under article 345 for the State Legislature to enact law adopting the language as official language of the State, which is in use in the State. "
We do not think that the requirement of article 347 can be read as a necessary requirement for the State Legislature to exercise its power under article 345. 
"We are in agreement with the view expressed by D.K. Trivedi, J. wherein he said, ""The only limitation imposed on the State Legislature under article 345 of the Constitution of India is that the said language must be in use in the State and further if any direction has been issued by the President under article 347 then the same will have a binding effect......"". "
"The criterion for adoption of one or more of the languages, other than Hindi, in the State is that those languages must be ""in the use in State"". "
This criterion must be satisfied at the time the State Legislature exercises its power under article 345. 
The State Legislature cannot adopt any language as official language if such language is not used in the State. 
"However, there is no impediment for the State Legislature to declare Hindi to be an official language even if Hindi is not ""in use"" in Karnataka. "
The reason for this is to be found in Constitutional compromise on the linguistic issue and the larger Constitutional charter for Hindi to facilitate the spread of Hindi across India. 
Learned senior counsel for the appellant argues that Chapter II of Part XVII engrafts a unique dichotomy involving the State Legislature at the State level and the Union Executive (the President) at the Central level. 
It provides two routes for designating a language as an official language in a State; (a) the adoption by law by the Legislature of the State; and (b) a direction by the President of India. 
These two routes are complementary. 
Learned senior counsel is right in his submission that the Constitution of India provides two routes as noted above for designating a language as an official language in a State. 
"However, the inference drawn by him that where the State Legislature has adopted a language as the official language, and there is a demand for recognition of another language which is used by a substantial proportion of the population of a State, the Constitution provides only one method for designating another language as the official language, which is through a Presidential direction under Article 347, is not entirely correct. "
"Insofar as article 347 is concerned, the learned senior counsel is right that if there is a demand for recognition of another language which is used by a substantial proportion of the population of a State, this could be done through Presidential direction article 347. "
"However, he is not right that this is the only method for designating another language as the official language. "
"If the construction of the learned senior counsel is accepted, it would restrict and limit the power of the State Legislature in adopting one or more languages in use in the State as official language. "
"The curtailment of the State Legislature's power under Article 345, as suggested by the learned senior counsel is neither Constitutionally sound nor does it flow from the scheme of Part XVII of the Constitution generally and the scheme engrafted under articles 345 and 347. "
"We do not find ourselves in agreement with the learned senior counsel that a situation where there is a demand for another official language, article 347 is the only manner known in the Constitution to respond to such a demand. "
"In our view, this is misunderstanding of articles 345 and 347. "
"In what we have stated above, we are unable to agree with the learned senior counsel for the appellant that since the Statement of Objects and Reasons accompanying the Uttar Pradesh Official Language (Amendment) Bill, 1989 expressly records ""demand for the declaration of Urdu as the second language of the State was made from time to time"", the impugned law covers the situation contemplated in article 347 and, therefore, invoking the legislative power by the State Legislature under article 345 is Constitutionally bad. "
A bare text of article 350 will show that it confers a Constitutional right on every person to submit a representation for redress of any grievance to any office of the Union or the State in any of the language used in the Union or the State. 
Learned senior counsel for the appellant does not dispute the position that the State Executive may adopt different languages for the convenience of the citizenry. 
"Obviously, then the State Legislature shall be within its Constitutional power with regard to field covered by article 345 to legislate by adopting a language or languages in use in the State subsequent to the adoption of Hindi as official language and so also adoption of more official languages. "
The exercise of legislative power by the State cannot be said to impinge upon the power given to the President under article 347 unless a Presidential directive is occupying the field. 
article 367 of the Constitution is an interpretational provision. 
(1) of article 367 reads: 
"Interpretation-(1) Unless the context otherwise requires, the General Clauses Act, 1897, shall, subject to any adaptations and modifications that may be made therein under Article 372, apply for the interpretation of this Constitution as it applies for the interpretation of an Act of the Legislature of the Dominion of India. "
(2) xxx xxx xxx 
(3) xxx xxx xxx 
"By virtue of the above provision in the Constitution, the provision of section 14 [c] of the General Clauses Act, 1897 applies to the interpretation of the Constitution and that leaves no manner of doubt that the State Legislature may exercise its power under article 345 from time to time. "
We do not find any merit in the argument of the learned senior counsel for the appellant that section 14 of the General Clauses Act has no application in the present case since a different intention appears in the Constitutional scheme of Part XVII. 
We have already explained the Constitutional scheme of Part XVII and so also ambit and scope of articles 345 and 347. 
"For the reasons we have indicated above, we do not find any merit in the argument of the learned senior counsel for the appellant that the power of the State Legislature under article 345 gets exhausted after a single use. "
The argument is Constitutionally flawed and does not flow from articles 345 and 347. 
"In our view, it will be unreasonable to construe article 345 in the manner suggested by the learned senior counsel for the appellant. "
It is said that law and language are both organic in their mode of development. 
"In India, these are evolving through the process of accepting legitimate aspirations of the speakers of different languages. "
Indian language laws are not rigid but accommodative - the object being to secure linguistic secularism. 
"Powers conferred to be exercisable from time to time.-(1) Where, by any Central Act or Regulation made after the commencement of this Act, any power is conferred then unless a different intention appears that power may be exercised from time to time as occasion requires. "
"(2) This section applies also to all Central Acts and Regulations made on or after the fourteenth day of January, 1887. "
"We hold, as we must, that neither insertion of section 3 in the 1989 Amendment Act nor the impugned notification in pursuance of the above provision notifying Urdu as the second language for seven purposes is unConstitutional. "
There is no merit in the appeal and it is dismissed with no order as to costs. 
Appeal dismissed 
"We are informed that Dr. Aloys Wobben (appellant no.1, hereinafter referred to as, 'the appellant') is a scientist-engineer. "
"It is also the case of the appellant, that he has to his credit several inventions in the field of wind turbine generators, and wind energy converters. "
"The appellant claims to be owner and holder of various intellectual property rights, including approximately 2,700 patents (in more than 60 countries). "
"Out of the aforesaid patents, we are informed, that the appellant has about 100 patents in India. "
The appellant is also engaged in the manufacture of wind-turbines. 
"In the field of wind turbines, he claims a position amongst the three largest manufacturers in the world. "
"The aforesaid manufacturing process is carried out by the appellant under the name of Enercon GmbH. Wobben Properties GmbH, appellant no.2, through an assignment agreement dated 05.01.2012, has acquired the right, title and interest in all the Indian registered designs and patents (including the pending registrations), belonging to Dr. Aloys Wobben. "
"The appellant's manufacturing process, is allegedly, carried out in about 27 countries. "
"The Enercon Group claims to employ more than 8,000 people, worldwide. "
"Insofar as India is concerned, Dr. Aloys Wobben has been carrying on the aforesaid manufacturing process, through a joint venture partnership with Yogesh Mehra and Ajay Mehra, (respondent nos.1 and 2 herein). "
The Indian enterprise is carried on in the trade name of Enercon India Limited (respondent no.3 herein). 
"The name of respondent No.3, we are informed, has since been changed to Wind World (India) Limited. "
"However, while dealing with the controversy in hand, we shall continue to refer to respondent No.3 as Enercon India Limited. "
"In fact, Yogesh Mehra and Ajay Mehra (aforementioned), are the directors of Enercon India Limited. "
"Enercon India Limited was formed in 1994 as a joint venture, between Enercon GmbH and respondent Nos.1 and 2. "
"Enercon India Limited, we are told, was originally carrying on its manufacturing process, in furtherance of licences granted by the appellant Dr. Aloys Wobben. "
"According to the appellant, the licences to use technical know-how, were vested by the appellant with Enercon India Limited, through written agreements. "
"These agreements were executed between the parties from time to time, and the last such agreement was executed on 29.9.2006. "
"These agreements, according to the appellant, were intellectual property licence agreements. "
"The last agreement dated 29.9.2006, we are informed, superseded all previous agreements (including the technical know-how agreement of 1994, and the technical know-how agreement of 2000). "
"It is also the case of the appellant, that the intellectual property licence agreement dated 29.9.2006, was terminated by Enercon GmbH, on 8.12.2008. "
"It is submitted, that non-fulfillment of the obligations contained in the intellectual property licence agreement dated 29.9.2006, was the reason for such termination. "
"According to the appellant, Dr. Aloys Wobben, despite the termination of all intellectual property licence agreements with Enercon India Limited, respondent nos.1 to 3 herein, continued the use of the appellant's patents, and as such, the intellectual property rights belonging to the appellant, without due authority. "
This action by respondent nos. 
"1 to 3 has been of extreme detriment to the appellant, as his technical know-how was being exploited by the respondents, without consideration or authorisation. "
"According to the factual position depicted in the impugned order, passed by the High Court of Delhi (hereinafter referred to as, the High Court), Enercon India Limited, had filed 19 ""revocation petitions"" before the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (hereinafter referred to as the ""Appellate Board"") section 64(1) of the Patents Act, 1970 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Patents Act'), in January 2009. "
"Through the aforesaid petitions, Enercon India Limited had sought revocation of the patents held in the name of the appellant. "
"Dissatisfied with the action of Enercon India Limited, in having approached the ""Appellate Board"", Dr. Aloys Wobben filed a number of ""patent infringement suits"". "
"In these suits, he impleaded, inter alia, Yogesh Mehra, Ajay Mehra and Enercon India Limited. "
We are informed that the first such suit (bearing No. 1349 of 2009) was filed on 27.7.2009. 
"Three other similar suits (bearing nos. 1963 of 2009, 1967 of 2009 and 1968 of 2009) were instituted on 20.10.2009. "
"The fifth suit (bearing No. 176 of 2010) was instituted on 28.1.2010, the sixth suit (bearing No. 1305 of 2010) was filed on 2.7.2010. "
The last suit (bearing No. 1333 of 2010) was instituted on 5.7.2010. 
"In all 10 ""patent infringement suits"", were filed after Enercon India Limited had already instituted 19 ""revocation petitions"", before the ""Appellate Board"". "
"It would be pertinent to mention, that the ""patent infringement suits"" were filed by the appellant Dr. Aloys Wobben, before the High Court. "
"In the above suits, it was open to the contesting respondents, to raise as a ""counter-claim"", a prayer for the revocation of the patent, which constituted the basis of the ""patent infringement suit"". "
"After the appellant had filed the abovementioned ""infringement suits"", the respondents filed ""counter-claims"" in response to some of the ""infringement suits"". "
"Illustratively, in response to the first suit bearing No. 1349 of 2009, the ""counter-claim"" was filed on 9.9.2009; to the suit bearing No. 1963 of 2009, the ""counter-claim"" was filed on 30.1.2010; to the suit bearing No. 176 of 2010, the ""counter-claim"" was filed on 30.4.2010. "
"Likewise, ""counter-claims"" were filed in the other suits as well. "
"Enercon India Limited is stated to have also filed 4 further ""revocation petitions"" before the ""Appellate Board"", after the appellant's institution of the ""patent infringement suits"" (referred to above). "
"These ""revocation petitions"" were filed by the respondents in 2010 and 2011. "
"The preceding two paragraphs, as well as the instant paragraph, depict the timing of the filing of the ""revocation petitions"" (by the respondents), the ""infringement suits"" (by the appellant) and the ""counter-claims"" (by the respondents). "
"From the narration of the factual position recorded above, it is apparent, that the contesting respondents filed 23 ""revocation petitions"" before the ""Appellate Board"", praying for the revocation of the patents held in the name of the appellant. "
"Exactly the same prayer has been made by the contesting respondents, by way of the ""counter-claims"", filed in response to the ""patent infringement suits"". "
"It is not a matter of dispute, that a number of ""revocation petitions"" filed by the respondents, have been settled by the ""Appellate Board"", whereas, some are still pending consideration. "
"Despite the above, the same issues are being re-agitated by the respondents, before the High Court, through the ""counter-claims"". "
"The main contentions advanced by the learned counsel for the appellants, emerge from section 64 of the Patents Act. "
"For a complete understanding of the said contentions, it is essential to extract section 64 hereunder: "
"section 64 - Revocation of patents-(1) Subject to the provisions contained in this Act, a patent, whether granted before or after the commencement of this Act, may, be revoked on a petition of any person interested or of the Central Government by the Appellate Board or on a counter-claim in a suit for infringement of the patent by the High Court on any of the following grounds that is to say- 	Statute
(a) that the invention, so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification, was claimed in a valid claim of earlier priority date contained in the complete specification of another patent granted in India; 	Statute
(b) that the patent was granted on the application of a person not entitled under the provisions of this Act to apply therefor; 	Statute
(c) that the patent was obtained wrongfully in contravention of the rights of the petitioner or any person under or through whom he claims; 	Statute
(d) that the subject of any claim of the complete specification is not an invention within the meaning of this Act; 	Statute
(e) that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification is not new, having regard to what was publicly known or publicly used in India before the priority date of the claim or to what was published in India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to in section 13; 	Statute
(f) that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification is obvious or does not involve any inventive step, having regard to what was publicly known or publicly used in India or what was published in India or elsewhere before the priority date of the claim: 	Statute
(g) that the invention, so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification, is not useful; 	Statute
(h) that the complete specification does not sufficiently and fairly describe the invention and the method by which it is to be performed, that is to say, that the description of the method or the instructions for the working of the invention as contained in the complete specification are not by themselves sufficient to enable a person in India possessing average skill in, and average knowledge of, the art to which the invention relates, to work the invention, or that it does not disclose the best method of performing it which was known to the applicant for the patent and for which he was entitled to claim protection; 	Statute
(i) that the scope of any claim of the complete specification is not sufficiently and clearly defined or that any claim of the complete specification is not fairly based on the matter disclosed in the specification; 	Statute
(j) that the patent was obtained on a false suggestion or representation; 	Statute
(k) that the subject of any claim of the complete specification is not patentable under this Act; 	Statute
(l) that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification was secretly used in India, otherwise than as mentioned in sub-section (3), before the priority date of the claim; 	Statute
(m) that the applicant for the patent has failed to disclose to the Controller the information required by section 8 or has furnished information which in any material particular was false to his knowledge; 	Statute
(n) that the applicant contravened any direction for secrecy passed section 35 or made or caused to be made an application for the grant of a patent outside India in contravention of section 39; 	Statute
(o) that leave to amend the complete specification section 57 or section 58 was obtained by fraud; 	Statute
(p) that the complete specification does not disclose or wrongly mentions the source or geographical origin of biological material used for the invention; 	Statute
(q) that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification was anticipated having regard to the knowledge, oral or otherwise, available within any local or indigenous community in India or elsewhere. 	Statute
(2) For the purposes of cls. 	Statute
(e) and (f) of sub-s. 	Statute
(a) no account shall be taken of personal document or secret trial or secret use; and 	Statute
(b) where the patent is for a process or for a product as made by a process described or claimed, the importation into India of the product made abroad by that process shall constitute knowledge or use in India of the invention on the date of the importation, except where such importation has been for the purpose of reasonable trial or experiment only. 	Statute
(3) For the purpose of cl. 	Statute
(1) of sub-s. 	Statute
(1) no account shall be taken of any use of the invention- 	Statute
(a) for the purpose of reasonable trial or experiment only; or 	Statute
(b) by the Government or by any person authorised by the Government or by a Government undertaking, in consequence of the applicant for the patent or any person from whom he derives title having communicated or disclosed the invention directly or indirectly to the Government or person authorised as aforesaid or to the Government undertaking; or 	Statute
(c) by any other person, in consequence of the applicant for the patent or any person from whom he derives title having communicated or disclosed the invention, and without the consent or acquiescence of the applicant or of any person from whom he derives title. 	Statute
(4) Without prejudice to the provisions contained in sub-s. 	Statute
(1) a patent may be revoked by the High Court on the petition of the Central Government, if the High Court is satisfied that the patentee has without reasonable cause failed to comply with the request of the Central Government to make, use or exercise the patented invention for the purposes of Government within the meaning of section 99 upon reasonable terms. 	Statute
(5) A notice of any petition for revocation of a patent under this section shall be served on all persons appearing from the register to be proprietors of that patent or to have shares or interests therein and it shall not be necessary to serve a notice on any other person. "
"Having extracted the relevant provision dealing with the revocation of a patent, relied upon by the learned counsel from the Patents Act, we shall endeavour to deal with the submissions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the appellants. "
"In our considered view, even though some of the submissions were differently worded, they were premised on exactly the same legal contentions, namely, that the defendant in an ""infringement suit"", having raised a ""counter-claim"" seeking revocation of a patent, the validity of such a challenge can be determined only at the hands of the High Court, i.e., while dealing with the ""counter-claim"". "
"And that, the ""Appellate Board"" would thereafter (after the filing of the ""counter-claim"" in the ""infringement suit""), cease to have the jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the validity of the patent. "
"The different submissions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the appellants, on the instant aspect of the matter, are being summarized hereunder: "
"Firstly, it was submitted, that where a ""counter-claim"" is instituted in response to a suit for infringement of a patent in the High Court, there can be no further proceeding in the ""revocation petition"" filed before the ""Appellate Board"". "
"In this behalf it was further contended, that it would make no difference, whether such proceedings had been instituted prior to, or after the filing of the suit for infringement. "
"Secondly, it was contended, that the jurisdiction of a High Court to decide a ""counter-claim"" for revocation, was exclusive, and could not be taken away, by initiating proceedings simultaneously, before the ""Appellate Board"". "
"In this behalf it was sought to be explained, that the proceedings before the High Court in furtherance of the ""counter-claim"", would negate all similar proceedings against the same patent, on the same grounds, before the subordinate forum (the ""Appellate Board""), for the simple reason, that the inferior forum would have to make way for the superior forum. "
"Thirdly, it was submitted, that the jurisdiction vested with the High Court, to decide a ""counter-claim"" seeking revocation of a patent in a suit for infringement, could not be taken away by an independent petition for revocation, of the same patent, and on the same grounds, pending before the ""Appellate Board"". "
"In this behalf it was submitted that the ""Appellate Board"" was only an administrative tribunal, which was neither superior to the High Court nor vested with a coequal status (as that of the High Court). "
"Accordingly it was submitted, that the determination by the ""Appellate Board"" which could even otherwise be corrected by the High Court (in an appropriate case, through writ proceeding) could not be allowed to derail the plea of revocation raised through the ""counter-claim"", before the High Court. "
"Fourthly, it was contended that once a ""counter-claim"" for revocation was instituted, the High Court alone would be vested with the charge for determining the merits of the plea of revocation. "
"Placing reliance on the proviso to section 104 of the Patents Act, it was sought to be asserted that once a ""counter-claim"" had been filed in a suit for infringement, the same was liable to be transferred to the High Court for determination. "
"Before we venture to deal with the submissions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the appellants, it is important to first analyze the options available for revocation of a patent section 64(1). "
"In our considered view, section 64(1) vests the liberty to raise a challenge to a patent in three different circumstances. "
"Firstly, on a petition by ""any person interested"". "
"Secondly, on a petition of the Central Government. "
"In case of the above two options, the petition for revocation would lie before the ""Appellate Board"". "
"Thirdly, by way of a ""counter-claim"" in a suit for infringement of a patent. "
The third option is adjudicable only by the jurisdictional High Court. 
"In view of the mandate contained in the provisions of the Patents Act, the locus standi for revocation of a patent, is available to three different entities, namely, ""any person interested"", ""the Central Government"", and to a defendant in an ""infringement suit"" by way of a ""counter-claim"". "
"Depending on the specific part of the provision relied on, such challenge is permissible before two different fora, i.e., the ""Appellate Board"", or the jurisdictional High Court. "
Our above determination emerges from a reading of Ss. 
64(1) and 104 of the Patents Act. 
"A perusal of section 64(1) of the Patents Act reveals, that more or less, generally speaking, revocation of a patent can be sought; if the patent was granted, despite there being a valid and genuine claim, of earlier priority (sub-s. "
(1)(a) of Section 64); or if the patent was granted to a person not entitled to the same (sub-s. 
"(1)(b) of Section 64); or if the patent was granted, wrongfully overlooking the rights of another (sub-s. "
"(1)(c) of Section 64); or if the patent was granted in respect of a matter, which is not an invention (sub-s. "
"(1)(d) of Section 64); or if the patent was granted in respect of a matter, which was not new (sub-s. "
"(1)(e) of Section 64); or if the patent was granted in respect of a matter, which is obvious, or does not involve any inventive step (sub-s. "
"(1)(f) of Section 64); or if the patent was granted in respect of a matter, which is not useful (sub-s. "
"(1)(g) of Section 64); or if the patent is granted in respect of a matter, which does not fully explain the description, or the working of the invention, to a person having a nexus to the subject to which the invention relates (sub-s. "
"(1)(h) of Section 64); or if the patent was granted in respect of a matter, which is not distinctly and definitely ascertainable (sub-s. "
"(1)(i) of Section 64); or if the patent was granted, on the basis of an inaccurate depiction/portrayal of the matter (sub-s. "
"1(j) of Section 64); or if the patent was granted in respect of a matter, which could not have been granted if the matter had been fully and completely disclosed (sub-s. "
"(1)(k) of Section 64); or if the patent was granted in respect of a matter, which was already secretly being used in India (sub-s. "
"(1)(l) of Section 64); or if the patent was granted, despite the failure to disclose the information of prosecuting an application for the grant of a patent, in a foreign country, or if such information had been wrongly furnished (sub-s. "
"(1)(m) of Section 64); or if the directions of secrecy, issued under the Patents Act, have been violated, or if an application has been made by a person resident in India for the grant of a patent outside India (sub-s. "
(1)(n) of Section 64); or if the amendment to the specification of the patent was obtained by fraud (sub-s. 
"(1)(o) of Section 64); or if the details of the invention, do not disclose (or wrongly disclose), the source or the origin of the biological material used therein (sub-s. "
"(1)(p) of Section 64); or if the details of the invention, were available within any local or indigenous community in India or elsewhere (sub-s. "
(1) (q) of section 64). 
"We shall now briefly notice, the remedies available to a person interested for raising a challenge to a patent granted to an individual or an entity, under the Patents Act, other than section 64. "
"It is critical, in the facts and circumstances of this case, to interpret section 64 of the Patents Act, in conjunction with the other provisions of the Patents Act, whereunder, the grant of a patent can also be assailed. "
"In this behalf, first and the foremost, reference needs to be made to section 25 of the Patents Act. "
section 25 is being extracted herein: 
"Opposition to the patent- (1) Where an application for a patent has been published but a patent has not been granted, any person may, in writing, represent by way of opposition to the Controller against the grant of patent on the ground- "
"(a) that the applicant for the patent or the person under or through whom he claims, wrongfully obtained the invention or any part thereof from him or from a person under or through whom he claims; "
(b) that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification has been published before the priority date of the claim- 
"(i) in any specification filed in pursuance of an application for a patent made in India on or after the 1st day of January, 1912; or "
"(ii) in India or elsewhere, in any other document: Provided that the ground specified in sub-cl. "
(ii) shall not be available where such publication does not constitute an anticipation of the invention by virtue of sub-s. 
(2) or sub-s. 
(3) of section 29; 
"(c) that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification is claimed in a claim of a complete specification published on or after the priority date of the applicant's claim and filed in pursuance of an application for a patent in India, being a claim of which the priority date is earlier than that of the applicant's claim; "
(d) that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification was publicly known or publicly used in India before the priority date of that claim. 
"Explanation - For the purposes of this clause, an invention relating to a process for which a patent is claimed shall be deemed to have been publicly known or publicly used in India before the priority date of the claim if a product made by that process had already been imported into India before that date except where such importation has been for the purpose of reasonable trial or experiment only; "
"(e) that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification is obvious and clearly does not involve any inventive step, having regard to the matter published as mentioned in cl. "
(b) or having regard to what was used in India before the priority date of the applicant's claim; 
"(f) that the subject of any claim of the complete specification is not an invention within the meaning of this Act, or is not patentable under this Act; "
(g) that the complete specification does not sufficiently and clearly describe the invention or the method by which it is to be performed; 
(h) that the applicant has failed to disclose to the Controller the information required by section 8 or has furnished the information which in any material particular was false to his knowledge; 
"(i) that in the case of a convention application, the application was not made within twelve months from the date of the first application for protection for the invention made in a convention country by the applicant or a person from whom he derives title; "
(j) that the complete specification does not disclose or wrongly mentions the source or geographical origin of biological material used for the invention; 
"(k) that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification is anticipated having regard to the knowledge, oral or otherwise, available within any local or indigenous community in India or elsewhere, but on no other ground, and the Controller shall, if requested by such person for being heard, hear him and dispose of such representation in such manner and within such period as may be prescribed. "
"(2) At any time after the grant of patent but before the expiry of a period of one year from the date of publication of grant of a patent, any person interested may give notice of opposition to the Controller in the prescribed manner on any of the following grounds, namely:- "
"(a) that the patentee or the person under or through whom he claims, wrongfully obtained the invention or any part thereof from him or from a person under or through whom he claims; "
"(ii) in India or elsewhere, in any other document: "
Provided that the ground specified in sub-cl. 
(ii) shall not be available where such publication does not constitute an anticipation of the invention by virtue of sub-s. 
(2) or sub-s. 
(3) of section 29; 
"(c) that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification is claimed in a claim of a complete specification published on or after the priority date of the claim of the patentee and filed in pursuance of an application for a patent in India, being a claim of which the priority date is earlier than that of the claim of the patentee; "
"Explanation.- For the purposes of this clause, an invention relating to a process for which a patent is claimed shall be deemed to have been publicly known or publicly used in India before the priority date of the claim if a product made by that process had already been imported into India before that date except where such importation has been for the purpose of reasonable trial or experiment only; "
(h) that the patentee has failed to disclose to the Controller the information required by section 8 or has furnished the information which in any material particular was false to his knowledge; 
"(i) that in the case of a patent granted on a convention application, the application for patent was not made within twelve months from the date of the first application for protection for the invention made in a convention country or in India by the patentee or a person from whom he derives title; "

"(k) that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification was anticipated having regard to the knowledge, oral or otherwise, available within any local or indigenous community in India or elsewhere, but on no other ground. "
"(3) (a) Where any such notice of opposition is duly given under sub-section (2), the Controller shall notify the patentee. "
"(b) On receipt of such notice of opposition, the Controller shall, by order in writing, constitute a Board to be known as the Opposition Board consisting of such officers as he may determine and refer such notice of opposition along with the documents to that Board for examination and submission of its recommendations to the Controller. "
(c) Every Opposition Board constituted under cl. 
(b) shall conduct the examination in accordance with such procedure as may be prescribed. 
"(4) On receipt of the recommendation of the Opposition Board and after giving the patentee and the opponent an opportunity of being heard, the "
Controller shall order either to maintain or to amend or to revoke the patent. 
(5) While passing an order under sub-s. 
(4) in respect of the ground mentioned in cl. 
(d) or cl. 
"(e) of sub-section (2), the Controller shall not take into account any personal document or secret trial or secret use. "
(6) In case the Controller issues an order under sub-s. 
"(4) that the patent shall be maintained subject to amendment of the specification or any other document, the patent shall stand amended accordingly."" "
"A perusal of section 25 of the Patents Act reveals, that ""any person"", and not just a ""person interested"" (as in the case of section 64 of the Patents Act), can ""represent by way of opposition"" against an application filed for the grant of a patent. "
"This opportunity, has been made available, even before a patent has been granted. "
"This opposition to the grant of a patent materializes, after an application for the grant of a patent has been published. "
"More or less, generally speaking, the grant of a patent can be opposed, if the applicant for the patent, had wrongfully obtained the invention, from the representationist, who opposes the grant of the patent (sub-s. "
"(1)(a) of Section 25); or if the application for the patent is published, before the priority date of the claim (sub-s. "
"(1)(b) of Section 25); or if the application for a patent in respect of an invention is published, after an application for the same invention, has already been published (sub-s. "
"(1)(c) of Section 25); or if an invention, in respect whereof a patent is sought, was publicly known or used before the priority date (sub-s. "
"(1)(d) of Section 25); or if an application is in respect of a matter, which is obvious and does not involve any inventive step (sub-s. "
"(1)(e) of Section 25); or if an application for a patent has been made in respect of a matter, which is not an invention (sub-s. "
"(1)(f) of Section 25); or if an application for a patent, has been made in a manner which does not clearly describe the invention, or the method by which it is to be performed (sub-s. "
"(1)(g) of Section 25); or if the applicant for a patent, has failed to disclose information, about his prosecuting an application for the grant of a patent, in a foreign country (sub-s. "
"(1)(h) of Section 25); or if the application for a patent, is in the nature of a convention application, and the application was made after more than one year, after the first application was made in a convention country (sub-s. "
"(1)(i) of Section 25); or if the application for a patent does not disclose (or wrongly discloses), the source or the origin of the biological material used therein (sub-s. "
"(1)(j) of Section 25); or if the application for an invention, is in respect of a matter which can be anticipated, having regard to the knowledge available within any local or indigenous community, in India or elsewhere (sub-s. "
(1)(k) of section 25). 
"A perusal of section 25(2) reveals that only a ""person interested"" and not ""any person"" (as in the case of section 25(1) of the Patents Act) may challenge the grant of a patent, within one year of the publication of such grant, by issuing a ""notice of opposition"" to the ""Controller"". "
"The above provision also reveals, more or less, generally speaking, such ""notice of opposition"" to the ""Controller"" can be made on the grounds depicted in sub-ss. "
"(1)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (h), (m), and (o) of section 64 of the Patents Act. "
"The remaining grounds for raising a challenge under section 25(2), coincide with those contained in section 25(1) of the Patents Act. "
"A challenge to the grant of a patent, through a ""notice of opposition"" is available, on all the grounds of challenge permitted to oppose, an application for the grant of a patent under sub-s. "
(1) of section 25. 
"There is however a substantial difference in the locus, for raising such a challenge, after the patent has been granted. "
"Whereas ""any person"" can ""represent by way of opposition"", to an application for the grant of a patent (under section 25(1) of the Patents Act), only a ""person interested"" can challenge the grant of a patent by issuing a ""notice of opposition"" (under section 25(2) of the Patents Act). "
"On the subject of locus, therefore, section 25(2) and section 64(1), are alike, inasmuch as, the locus to raise a challenge to a patent granted, lies with ""any person interested"" in both of these provisions. "
"A challenge to the grant of a patent can also be raised by a defendant in a ""patent infringement suit"". "
"This can be done by the defendant by filing a ""counter-claim"" in a ""patent infringement suit"". "
"When a challenge is raised at the pre-grant stage, under section 25(1) of the Patents Act, the same is liable to be determined at the hands of the ""Controller"". "
"An order passed by the ""Controller"" can be assailed by way of an appeal before the ""Appellate Board"". "
"When a challenge is raised under section 25(2), it must be raised within one year of the publication of the grant (of patent). "
"The same has to be examined, in the first instance, by an ""Opposition Board"" contemplated under section 25(3). "
"The recommendations made by the ""Opposition Board"" are then to be placed before the ""Controller"" for consideration. "
"After issuing notice to the patent-holder, and after affording an opportunity of hearing to the patent-holder, the ""Controller"" is required to pass the final order, on a notice of opposition filed under section 25(2). "
"Such order passed by the ""Controller"" is assailable by way of an appeal, before the ""Appellate Board"". "
"A challenge raised by ""any person interested"", section 64(1), is liable to be adjudicated, at the very first instance, by the ""Appellate Board"". "
"If in response to an ""infringement suit"", the defendant files a ""counter-claim"" seeking the revocation of the concerned patent, the said process of adjudication would lie before the jurisdictional High Court (see, the proviso to Ss. "
64(1) and 104 of the Patents Act). 
"Having heard learned counsel, and having examined the different provisions of the Patents Act, relating to revocation of patents, we shall now endeavour to examine the controversy in hand. "
"In our considered view, section 64 of the Patents Act needs a close examination. "
"section 64 aforementioned, is prefaced by the words ""Subject to the provisions contained in this Act,....."". "
"And not by the words, ""Without prejudice to the provisions contained in this Act....."", or ""Notwithstanding the provisions contained in this Act..."". "
"The words with which the legislature has prefaced Section 64, necessarily lead to the inference, that the provisions contained in section 64 are subservient to all the other provisions contained in the Patents Act. "
"This exordium to section 64 of the Patents Act mandates, that the directive contained in Section 64, would be subservient and deferential, to the other provisions of the Patents Act. "
"Stated simply, if there is any provision under the Patents Act, which is in conflict with the mandate contained in Section 64, section 64 of the Patents Act would stand eclipsed, and the other provision(s), would govern the field under reference. "
"Therefore, no interpretation can be placed on section 64 of the Patents Act, which will be in conflict with, any other provision(s) of the Patents Act. "
"If any proceedings have been initiated by ""any person interested"", under section 25(2) of the Patents Act, the same will eclipse the right of the same person to file a ""revocation petition"" section 64(1) of the Patents Act. "
"And also, to invoke the right granted section 64(1) of the Patents Act, to file a ""counter-claim"" (in response to an ""infringement suit"", to seek the revocation of a patent). "
"This, in our view, would be the natural effect of the words, ""Subject to the provisions contained in this Act....."", appearing at the beginning of section 64(1) of the Patents Act. "
"And if, the above meaning is not to be assigned to the words ""Subject to the provisions of this Act....."", they would be redundant and superfluous. "
It is however not necessary to pay a serious thought to the situation referred to above. 
"The above situation, in our considered view, is unlikely to ever arise. "
"This is because, section 25 of the Patents Act, inter alia, provides for the procedure, for the grant of a patent. "
The procedure commences with the filing of an application. 
The second step contemplates publication of the details of the patent sought. 
"The next step envisages, the filing of representations by way of opposition (to the grant of the patent). "
"This advances into a determination by the ""Controller"", to grant or refuse the patent. "
"The decision of the ""Controller"", leads to the publication of the grant (of the patent). "
This process finalises the decision of the grant of the patent. 
"All the same, it does not finally crystalise, the right of the patent holder. "
"After the grant is published, ""any person interested"", can issue a notice of opposition, within one year of the date of publication of the grant of a patent. "
"If and when, challenges raised to the grant of a patent are disposed of favourably, to the advantage of the patent holder, the right to hold the patent can then and then alone, be stated to have crystallized. "
"Likewise, if no notice of opposition is preferred, within one year of the date of publication of the grant of a patent, the grant would be deemed to have crystallized. "
"Thus, only the culmination of procedure contemplated under section 25(2) of the Patents Act, bestows the final approval to the patent. "
"Therefore, it is unlikely and quite impossible, that an ""infringement suit"" would be filed, while the proceedings under section 25(2) are pending, or within a year of the date of publication of the grant of a patent. "
"The defendant party to a suit for infringement, who seeks to repudiate the charge of infringement, is allowed to raise a ""counter-claim"", so as to enable him to raise a challenge, to the validity of the patent assigned to the author of the suit (under section 64 of the Patents Act). "
"This is so, because a ""counter-claim"" can be filed only by such person, against whom a suit for infringement has been filed (by the patent-holder). "
The grounds of such challenge have already been enumerated above. 
"A corrective mechanism is also available to ""any person interested"", to assail the grant of a patent section 64(1) of the Patents Act. "
"This is in addition, to a similar remedy provided to ""any person interested"", under section 25(2) of the Patents Act. "
"In the above scenario, it is necessary to first appreciate the true purport of the words ""any person interested"". "
"The term ""person interested"" has been defined in section 2(1)(t) of the Patents Act. "
"Unless the context otherwise requires, in terms of section 2(1)(t) aforementioned, a ""person interested"" would be one who is...""engaged in, or in promoting, research in the same field as that to which the invention relates"". "
"Simply stated, a ""person interested"" would include a person who has a direct, present and tangible interest with a patent, and the grant of the patent, adversely affects his above rights. "
"A ""person interested"" would include any individual who desires to make independent use of either the invention itself (which has been patented), or desires to exploit the process (which has been patented) in his individual production activity. "
"Therefore, the term ""any person interested"" is not static. "
"The same person, may not be a ""person interested"" when the grant of the concerned patent was published, and yet on account of his activities at a later point in time, he may assume such a character or disposition. "
"It is, therefore, that section 64 of the Patents Act additionally vests in ""any person interested"", the liberty to assail the grant of a patent, by seeking its revocation. "
"The grounds of such challenge, have already been enumerated above. "
"Based on the two remedies contemplated under section 64 of the Patents Act, the fifth contention of the learned counsel for the appellants was, that the use of the word ""or"" in section 64(1) demonstrates, that the liberty granted to any person interested to file a ""revocation petition"", to challenge the grant of a patent to an individual, cannot be adopted simultaneously by the same person, i.e., firstly, by filing a ""revocation petition"", and at the same time, by filing a ""counter-claim"" in a suit for infringement. "
"It is the submission of the learned counsel for the appellants, that the word ""or"" is clearly disjunctive, and cannot be read as conjunctive. "
"The above remedies, expressed in section 64(1) of the Patents Act, according to learned counsel, cannot be availed of by the same person, simultaneously. "
"According to learned counsel, the concerned person must choose one of the above remedies. "
"It is the pointed assertion of the learned counsel for the appellants, that in the present case the respondents, by assuming the position and posture of ""any person interested"", have filed ""revocation petition(s)"" to assail the same patent, which have at the same time been assailed by filing ""counter-claims"". "
"The above ""counter-claims"" have been filed in response to the ""infringement suit(s)"", preferred by the appellant. "
"It is the submission of the learned counsel for the appellants, that the respondents must choose only one, of the above remedies. "
"The course of action adopted by the respondents, according to the learned counsel for the appellants, could lead to one finding in the ""revocation petition"", and a different finding in the ""counter-claim"". "
"We do not have the slightest hesitation in accepting the above contention (fifth in the series of contentions), that even though more than one remedies are available to the respondents in section 64 of the Patents Act, the word ""or"" used therein separating the different remedies provided therein, would disentitle them, to avail of both the remedies, for the same purpose, simultaneously. "
"On principle also, this would be the correct legal position. "
"Keeping in view the submissions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the appellants (as have been noticed in the foregoing paragraphs), the question which arises for determination is, that having chosen both the above remedies, which one of the two, should the respondents, be permitted to pursue. "
"The answer to the above query, will, if possible, have to be determined from the provisions of the Patents Act itself. "
"In this behalf we may at the outset record, that learned counsel for the rival parties, did not invite our attention to any provision from the Patents Act, which would provide a clear pointer, to the course to be adopted. "
"Whilst it was undoubtedly submitted, on the one hand, that the choice should fall in favour of the superior forum. "
"Details about the locus, in respect of other challenges have been narrated in paragraph 16 hereinabove. "
"We may in the passing record, that the determination of the ""counter-claim"" would be with the superior forum, i.e., the jurisdictional High Court (Ss. 64(1) and 104 of the Patents Act). "
"The above submission was sought to be countered, on the other hand, by pointing out, that the opportunities provided by the legislature to assail the order(s) passed under the Patents Act, could not be reduced. "
"In this behalf, it was submitted, that the remedies provided by the legislature, where a ""revocation petition"" is filed, were far in excess of the remedies, in case revocation was sought through a ""counter-claim"". "
"The legitimate inference derived from the former submission, was thus equally legitimately, repudiated by the latter contention. "
"Since no legitimate solution could emerge from the provisions of the Patents Act, it would be essential, to rely on known principles of law, to resolve the issue. "
"We shall therefore attempt to resolve the issue, on accepted principles of law. "
"A ""counter-claim"" for all intents and purposes, must be understood as a suit, filed by one who is impleaded as a defendant. "
"A ""counter-claim"" is essentially filed to obstruct the claim raised in a suit. "
"A ""counter-claim"" is tried jointly, with the suit filed by the plaintiff, and has the same effect as a cross-suit. "
"Therefore, for all intents and purposes a ""counter-claim"" is treated as a plaint, and is governed by the rules applicable to plaints. "
"The court trying a suit, as well as, the ""counter-claim"", has to pronounce its judgment on the prayer(s) made in the suit, and also, those made in the ""counter-claim"". "
"Since a ""counter-claim"" is of the nature of an independent suit, a ""counter-claim"" cannot be allowed to proceed, where the defendant has already instituted a suit against the plaintiff, on the same cause of action. "
"The above conclusion is drawn on the basis of the accepted principle of law crystallized in section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as, the CPC) read with section 151 of the CPC. "
Both the above provisions are being extracted hereunder:- 
"Stay of suit.- No Court shall proceed with the trial of any suit in which the matter in issue is also directly and substantially in issue in a previously instituted suit between the same parties, or between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title where such suit is pending in the same or any other Court in India having jurisdiction to grant the relief claimed, or in any Court beyond the limits of India established or continued by the Central Government and having like jurisdiction, or before the Supreme Court. "
Explanation- The pendency of a suit in a foreign Court does not preclude the Courts in India from trying a suit founded on the same cause of action. 
"Saving of inherent powers of Court.- Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect the inherent power of the Court to make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the Court."" "
"Therefore, where an issue is already pending adjudication between the same parties, in a Court having jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the same, a subsequently instituted suit on the same issue between the same parties, cannot be allowed to proceed. "
"A similar question arises for consideration before this Court, in the present controversy. "
"If the respondents in their capacity as ""any person interested"", had filed a ""revocation petition"" before the institution of an ""infringement suit"", they cannot be permitted to file a ""counter-claim"" on the same cause of action. "
"The natural conclusion in the above situation would be, the validity of the grant of the patent would have to be determined in the ""revocation petition"". "
"Therefore, in the above situation, while the ""revocation petition"" will have to be permitted to be pursued, the ""counter-claim"" cannot be permitted to be continued. "
"Therefore, in the above eventuality, it is apparent that the situation would be resolved, in the same manner, as it would have been resolved in cross-suits filed by the rival parties, before different jurisdictional courts. "
"In our considered view, the above conclusion is imperative for a harmonious interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Patents Act. "
"In cases where the ""infringement suit(s)"" was/were filed by the appellant herein (as plaintiff in the ""infringement suit""), before the ""revocation petition(s)"" was/were filed by the respondents (as defendants in the ""infringement suit""), the respondents had the right to file ""counter-claim(s)"" to seek revocation of the patent, under the strength and authority emerging from section 64(1) of the Patents Act. "
"Having once filed a ""counter-claim"", in response to the ""infringement suit(s)"", on the same analogy as has been recorded above, it would not be open to the respondents herein (the defendants in the ""infringement suits"") to file ""revocation petition(s)"", as they would likewise be barred by the rule of res judicata. "
"As such, ""revocation petitions"" filed later in point of time, than the institution of the ""infringement suit"", would be unsustainable in law. "
"In such cases, the prayer for revocation of the patent shall be adjudicated, while disposing of the ""counter-claim"" filed by the respondents. "
"Therefore, in the above situation, while the ""counter-claim"" will have to be permitted to be pursued, the ""revocation petition"" cannot be permitted to be continued. "
"Having examined the four contentions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the appellants (delineated in paragraph 9 of the instant judgment) and the fifth contention (noticed in paragraph 21 of our instant determination), we are of the view that the following conclusions emerge therefrom: "
"Firstly, if ""any person interested"" has filed proceedings under section 25(2) of the Patents Act, the same would eclipse all similar rights available to the very same person section 64(1) of the Patents Act. "
"This would include the right to file a ""revocation petition"" in the capacity of ""any person interested"" (section 64(1) of the Patents Act), as also, the right to seek the revocation of a patent in the capacity of a defendant through a ""counter-claim"" (also section 64(1) of the Patents Act). "
"Secondly, if a ""revocation petition"" is filed by ""any person interested"" in exercise of the liberty vested in him section 64(1) of the Patents Act, prior to the institution of an ""infringement suit"" against him, he would be disentitled in law from seeking the revocation of the patent (on the basis whereof an ""infringement suit"" has been filed against him) through a ""counter-claim"". "
"This denial of the remedy granted to him by way of a ""counter-claim"" section 64(1) of the Patents Act, is based on the principle of law narrated in paragraph 24 above. "
"Thirdly, where in response to an ""infringement suit"", the defendant has already sought the revocation of a patent (on the basis whereof the ""infringement suit"" has been filed) through a ""counter-claim"", the defendant cannot thereafter, in his capacity as ""any person interested"" assail the concerned patent, by way of a ""revocation petition"". "
"This denial of remedy granted to him by way of a ""revocation petition"" section 64(1) of the Patents Act, is also based on the same principle of law expressed in paragraph 24 above. "
"The sixth contention advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the appellants was, that insofar as the present controversy is concerned, the same was liable to be governed by the consent order, which was passed by the High Court on 1.9.2010, wherein the respondents (as defendants) had agreed, that the suits and ""counter-claims"" pending between the parties should be consolidated, and should be heard by the High Court itself. "
The above consent order is being extracted hereunder:-

"It was also the submission of the learned counsel for the appellants, that the above consent order was given effect to, inasmuch as, the High Court had framed issues in the ""infringement suits"" and ""counter-claims"", on 20.9.2011. "
"It was submitted, that even after the above consent order dated 1.9.2010 was passed by the High Court, the respondents had continued to pursue their ""revocation petitions"" before the ""Appellate Board"". "
"Consequent upon the aforesaid course having been adopted by the respondents, it was submitted, that orders of revocation had been passed in respect of six patents granted to the appellant. "
"It was submitted, that all the above patents were also subject to consideration in ""counter-claims"", pending before the High Court. "
"It was also the contention of the learned counsel for the appellants, that the course adopted by the respondents amounted to misuse of the judicial process. "
"It was accordingly submitted, that the above course adopted by the respondents being wrong and illegal, should not be permitted. "
"In this behalf, it was also the contention of the learned counsel for the appellants, that pursuing multifarious proceedings, in respect of the same cause of action, between the same parties, was impermissible in law. "
We have given our thoughtful consideration to the sixth contention advanced on behalf of the learned counsel for the appellants. 
"It is now well settled, that rules of procedure are meant to ensure justice to the concerned parties, based on their substantive rights. "
"It is therefore commonly said, that all rules of procedure, are nothing but handmaids of justice. "
"In a matter as the one in hand, if the dispute has to be settled stricto sensu, according to the procedure envisaged by law, the course to be adopted, has already been delineated by us above. "
"We have resolved in our conclusions recorded hereinabove, the remedy which will have to be adopted by the concerned parties, depending upon the date of institution of proceedings under section 25(2) of the Patents Act, the date of institution of a ""revocation petition"" section 64(1) of the Patents Act, as also, the date of institution of a counter-claim in an ""infringement suit"", under Chapter XVIII of the Patents Act. "
"Based on the factual position noticed at the beginning of the instant order, it is apparent, that the appellant has filed at least 19 ""infringement suits"", and the respondents have filed at least 23 ""revocation petitions"". "
"The respondents have also filed ""counter-claims"" to the ""patent infringement suits"" filed by the appellant. "
"In the present facts and circumstances, even though the challenge to the same patent, by our above determination, has been limited to a specific singular challenge, as against multiple challenges as at present, yet the same are to be pursued before different fora. "
"In the instant case, the disputation is of the same nature, and between the same parties, even though it may be in respect of different patents. "
"As such, it would be convenient for the parties concerned, to agree to resolve the same, before a singular adjudicatory authority. "
That will also be convenient for the concerned adjudicatory authority. 
"Accordingly, for convenience of the parties concerned, it would be open for them by consent, to accept one of the remedies, out of the plural remedies, which they would have to pursue in the different cases, pending between them, to settle their dispute. "
"Having consented to one of the available remedies postulated under law, it would not be open to either of the consenting parties, to seek redressal from a forum in addition to the consented forum. "
"We, therefore hereby affirm, that the consent order passed by the High Court on 1.9.2010, being on the subject of procedure, and being before a forum which had the statutory jurisdiction to deal with the same, was fully justified in the facts and circumstances of the present case. "
"The next and the last contention advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the appellants, was based on section 124 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as, 'the Trade Marks Act'). "
section 124 aforementioned is being extracted hereunder:- 
"Stay of proceedings where the validity of registration of the trade mark is questioned, etc.- "
(1) Where in any suit for infringement of a trade mark- 
(a) the defendant pleads that registration of the plaintiff's trade mark is invalid; or 
(b) the defendant raises a defence under cl. 
(e) of sub-s. 
"(2) of section 30 and the plaintiff pleads the invalidity of registration of the defendant's trade mark, the court trying the suit (hereinafter referred to as the court), shall,- "
"(i) if any proceedings for rectification of the register in relation to the plaintiff's or defendant's trade mark are pending before the Registrar or the Appellate Board, stay the suit pending the final disposal of such proceedings; "
"(ii) if no such proceedings are pending and the court is satisfied that the plea regarding the invalidity of the registration of the plaintiff's or defendant's trade mark is prima facie tenable, raise an issue regarding the same and adjourn the case for a period of three months from the date of the framing of the issue in order to enable the party concerned to apply to the Appellate Board for rectification of the register. "
(2) If the party concerned proves to the court that he has made any such application as is referred to in cl. 
(b) (ii) of sub-s. 
"(1) within the time specified therein or within such extended time as the court may for sufficient cause allow, the trial of the suit shall stand stayed until the final disposal of the rectification proceedings. "
"(3) If no such application as aforesaid has been made within the time so specified or within such extended time as the court may allow, the issue as to the validity of the registration of the trade mark concerned shall be deemed to have been abandoned and the court shall proceed with the suit in regard to the other issues in the case. "
(4) The final order made in any rectification proceedings referred to in sub-s. 
(1) or sub-s. 
(2) shall be binding upon the parties and the court shall dispose of the suit conformably to such order in so far as it relates to the issue as to the validity of the registration of the trade mark. 
"(5) The stay of a suit for the infringement of a trade mark under this section shall not preclude the court from making any interlocutory order (including any order granting an injunction directing account to be kept, appointing a receiver or attaching any property), during the period of the stay of the suit."" "
"It was the vehement contention of the learned counsel for the appellants, that a similar situation, as the one which has arisen in the present controversy, has been dealt with by the legislature under the Trade Marks Act, inasmuch as, section 124 gives power to the concerned court to stay the proceedings in a suit for infringement of a trade mark, pending final disposal of proceedings, for rectification of the trade mark, initiated by the defendants before the ""Appellate Board"". "
"It was accordingly the contention of the learned counsel for the appellants, that even though a similar situation, as the one catered to under the Trade Marks Act, could arise out of a disputed grant of a patent under the Patents Act, no such protective measure has been provided for by the legislature under the Patents Act. "
"It is necessary to keep in mind, that the instant submission was advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the reason, that the appellants did not desire two proceedings, on the subject of revocation of the same patent, to be continued simultaneously before different fora. "
"In our discussion recorded while dealing with the submission advanced by the learned counsel for the appellants, we have accepted the contention advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the appellants, that only one out of two remedies available under section 64 of the Patents Act, can be availed of, so as to assail the grant of a patent. "
"Accordingly the said remedy may be availed of in the capacity of either ""any person interested"", or in the capacity of a defendant in a ""counter-claim"". "
"We have already concluded hereinabove, that having availed of any one of the above remedies, it is not open to the same person to assail the grant of a patent by choosing the second alternative available to him. "
"In view of our above conclusion, the instant submission advanced by the learned counsel for the appellants does not survive for consideration. "
"The impugned order is therefore set aside, in the terms recorded hereinabove. "
The appeal is disposed of in the above terms. 
Appeal disposed of 
"A two-Judge Bench while dealing with the interpretation of provisions of Sections 33C(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (for short, ""the Act"") vis-a-vis a Voluntary Retirement Scheme framed by the State of Andhra Pradesh noticed that the conclusion arrived at by the Division Bench of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in Writ Appeal No. 820 of 2005, whereby it had given the stamp of approval to the judgment and order dated 21st March, 2005, passed by the learned Single Judge of the said Court in Writ Petition No. 4196 of 2005, holding, inter alia, that once the workmen had availed the Voluntary Retirement Scheme and received the special compensation package, they could not have put forth a claim for lay-off compensation under Section 33C(2) of the Act and in that context perceived a discordant note in National Buildings Construction Corporation v. Pritam Singh Gill and others (1972) 2 SCC 1 1972 Indlaw SC 381 and A.K. Bindal and another v. Union of India and others (2003) 5 SCC 163 2003 Indlaw SC 363 and thereafter scanning the anatomy of the Act, referred the matter to a larger Bench in A. Satyanarayana Reddy and others v. Presiding Officer, Labour Court, Guntur and others (2008) 5 SCC 280 2008 Indlaw SC 880 by stating thus:- "
"The right of the workman to claim payment of lay off compensation is not denied or disputed. 	Ruling by Lower Court
If the said claim has no nexus with the Voluntary Retirement Scheme, in our opinion, in a given case, like the present one, it is possible to hold that a proceeding under Section 33C(2) of the Act would be maintainable. 	Ruling by Lower Court
We are, therefore, of the opinion that the question being one of some importance should be considered by the larger Bench as there exists an apparent conflict in the said decisions in National Buildings Construction Corporation 1972 Indlaw SC 381 (supra) and A.K. Bindal 2003 Indlaw SC 363 (supra). "
"Because of the aforesaid order, the matter has been placed before us. "
"The expose of facts are that the appellants were employees of Nagarjuna Cooperative Sugars Limited (for short, ""the Company""), a Government of Andhra Pradesh undertaking. "
"It was declared as a ""relief undertaking"" in terms of the A.P. Relief Undertaking (Special Provisions) Act, 1971 (for brevity, ""the 1971 Act""). "
"As is evident, the management of the industrial undertaking declared lay-off wherefor compensation was to be paid. "
"The employees-union of the Company preferred a writ petition in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh assailing the Memorandum No. 25027/SUG/A2/97-3 dated 5th January, 1998, whereunder the workmen were not granted compensation and, in fact, were deprived of the same. "
"It was urged by the workmen that the lay-off compensation was paid only for the months of June and July, 1995, though they were entitled to get the said compensation for the period 01.08.1995 to 06.09.2002. "
"When the matter stood thus, the State of Andhra Pradesh transferred the Company to one S.C.M. Sugars Limited, which absorbed some of the workmen, and out of the said absorbed employees, some of them were paid lay-off compensation and some were not extended the benefit. "
"Be it stated, at one point of time all the employees had expressed their willingness to continue to work under the transferee-management. "
"At a later stage, the Government of Andhra Pradesh allowed the said transferee-Company to shift the factory to the State of Karnataka, as a consequence of which, the workmen lost the opportunity to continue to be employed. "
"As the factual matrix would unfurl, the Government of Andhra Pradesh issued G.O.Ms. "
"No. 25 dated 21st May, 2001, provided for a special compensation package for the employees. "
The condition that was incorporated in the package was to the effect that the amount of compensation was to be paid to the workmen only in the event if they had not opted for employment with the transferee Company. 
We shall refer to the Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) at a later stage. 
"As the factual score would further undrape, the appellants opted for voluntary retirement and they were paid the amount of special compensation in terms of the VRS. "
"It is apposite to note here that as the said scheme did not make any provision for payment of lay-off compensation, the appellants moved the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India by preferring Writ Petition No.16916 of 1998. "
"The relief sought in the writ petition was resisted by the transferee Company urging that the workmen having accepted the benefits under the VRS and there had been cessation of relationship between the employer and employee, the writ petition was not maintainable and the relief sought in the writ petition could not be acceded to. "
The learned Single Judge upon hearing the learned counsel for the parties opined that it would be appropriate for the writ petitioners to approach the Industrial Tribunal and work out their remedies by way of a claim petition and by leading appropriate evidence before the said Court. 
"The High Court, be it noted, granted liberty to the workmen to raise all issues which were available including those which had been raised in the writ petition, and accordingly disposed of the writ petition. "
"In pursuance of the aforesaid order, the workmen filed a petition under Section 33C(2) of the Act claiming lay-off compensation before the Presiding Officer, Labour Court, Guntur that formed the subject matter of C.F.R. No. 4319/2004 III Un-No. "
The Labour Court dismissed the application as not maintainable on the foundation that the claimants were not workmen under Section 2(s) of the Act having received all the benefits under VRS. 
"Aggrieved by the aforesaid order of the Labour Court, the appellants herein preferred W.P. No. 4196 of 2005. "
"The learned Single Judge referred to the authority in A.K. Bindal 2003 Indlaw SC 363 (supra), adverted to the decision of the Bombay High Court in Pal v. Pal VRS Employees Welfare Association 2002 - 1 LLJ Bombay 527 2001 Indlaw MUM 233, that dealt with ""existing individual rights"" in the context of Section 33C(2) of the Act, distinguished the decision rendered in Government Soap Factory, Bangalore v. Labour Court AIR 1970 Mysore 225 1969 Indlaw KAR 97 and eventually held that the Labour Court had correctly exercised the jurisdiction by coming to hold that the writ petitioners were no more workmen within the meaning of Section 2(s) of the Act and hence, there was no warrant for any interference in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. "
Dissatisfaction of non-success compelled the writ petitioners to prefer Writ Appeal No. 820 of 2005 and the Division Bench concurred with the view expressed by the learned Single Judge in view of the dictum of this Court in A.K. Bindal 2003 Indlaw SC 363 (supra). 
"Hence, the present appeal by special leave. "
We have already noted how the matter has been placed before the three-Judge Bench. 
Section 2(s) of the Act defines the workman as follows:- 
"workman"" means any person (including an apprentice) employed in any industry to do any manual, unskilled, skilled, technical, operational, clerical or supervisory work for hire or reward, whether the terms of employment be express or implied, and for the purposes of any proceeding under this Act in relation to an industrial dispute, includes any such person who has been dismissed, discharged or retrenched in connection with, or as a consequence of, that dispute, or whose dismissal, discharge or retrenchment has led to that dispute, but does not include any such person - "
"(i) who is subject to the Air Force Act, 1950 (45 of 1950), or the Army Act,1950 (46 of 1950), or the Navy Act, 1957 (62 of 1957); or "
(ii) who is employed in the police service or as an officer or other employee of a prison; or 
(iii) who is employed mainly in a managerial or administrative capacity; or 
"(iv) who, being employed in a supervisory capacity, draws wages exceeding [ten thousand rupees] per mensem or exercises, either by the nature of the duties attached to the office or by reason of the powers vested in him, functions mainly of a managerial nature."" "
Section 33C(2) of the Act reads as follows:- 
"Where any workman is entitled to receive from the employer any money or any benefit which is capable of being computed in terms of money and if any question arises as to the amount of money due or as to the amount at which such benefit should be computed, then the question may, subject to any rules that may be made under this Act, be decided by such Labour Court as may be specified in this behalf by the appropriate Government [within a period not exceeding three months]: 	Statute
Provided that where the presiding officer of a Labour Court considers it necessary or expedient so to do, he may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, extend such period by such further period as he may think fit. "
"In A.K. Bindal 2003 Indlaw SC 363 (supra) a two-Judge Bench was considering the grant of pay revision in respect of companies which came under the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (for short, ""BIFR""). "
In the said case an issue also arose with regard to the framing of voluntary retirement scheme pertaining to the grievance of non-revision of the pay scale of the workmen. 
"It was contended by the respondents therein that the employees having taken VRS and having taken the amount without any demur, the relationship of employee and employer had ceased to exist and, therefore, they cannot raise any grievance regarding the non-revision of pay scale. "
"The said submission was opposed on the ground that employees had no option in the matter and accepted VRS under compulsion and further under the VRS, the total compensation amounts have to be calculated as there was revision of pay scale since 1992 as claimed by the workmen and in that context opined thus:- "
This shows that a considerable amount is to be paid to an employee ex gratia besides the terminal benefits in case he opts for voluntary retirement under the Scheme and his option is accepted. 
The amount is paid not for doing any work or rendering any service. 
It is paid in lieu of the employee himself leaving the services of the company or the industrial establishment and foregoing all his claims or rights in the same. 
It is a package deal of give and take. 
"That is why in the business world it is known as ""golden handshake"". "
The main purpose of paying this amount is to bring about a complete cessation of the jural relationship between the employer and the employee. 
"After the amount is paid and the employee ceases to be under the employment of the company or the undertaking, he leaves with all his rights and there is no question of his again agitating for any kind of his past rights with his erstwhile employer including making any claim with regard to enhancement of pay scale for an earlier period. "
"If the employee is still permitted to raise a grievance regarding enhancement of pay scale from a retrospective date, even after he has opted for Voluntary Retirement Scheme and has accepted the amount paid to him, the whole purpose of introducing the Scheme would be totally frustrated. "
The contention that the employees opted for VRS under any kind of compulsion is not worthy of acceptance. 
The petitioners are officers of the two Companies and are mature enough to weigh the pros and cons of the options which were available to them. 
They could have waited and pursued their claim for revision of pay scale without opting for VRS. 
"However, they in their wisdom thought that in the fact situation VRS was a better option available and chose the same. "
After having applied for VRS and taken the money it is not open to them to contend that they exercised the option under any kind of compulsion. 
"In view of the fact that nearly ninety-nine per cent of employees have availed of the VRS Scheme and have left the Companies (FCI and HFC), the writ petition no longer survives and has become infructuous."" "
"In Pritam Singh Gill 1972 Indlaw SC 381 (supra), this Court was dealing with a case wherein the respondent was dismissed from service w.e.f. September 19, 1967. "
"He was suspended on October 5, 1964 and the order of suspension remained in force till September 18, 1967. "
"During the period of suspension, on October 7, 1965, he was transferred to Delhi. "
After dismissal the respondent applied to the Labour Court at Delhi under Section 33C(2) of the Act for computing the benefits and amounts he was entitled to receive alleging that he had not been paid such amounts and benefits. 
The Labour Court framed certain issues and decided the claim in favour of the employee. 
The only question that arose before this Court pertained to jurisdiction of the Labour Court to entertain the employees' application under Section 33C(2) of the Act. 
"According to the appellants, the respondent-employee having already been dismissed had ceased to be the workman from the date of application and, therefore, he had no locus standi to approach the Labour Court under Section 33C(2) of the Act. "
"On behalf of the respondent, it was argued that if the period in respect of which benefits and amounts are claimed under Section 33C(2) of the Act was during the course of his employment prior to dismissal, then mere fact that he was dismissed by the employer before he could apply to the Labour Court under Section 33C(2) would not deprive him of his right to claim relief under that Section. "
The Court posed the question whether Section 33C(2) of the Act can be invoked by dismissed workman in respect of benefits and salary due to him for the period prior to the date of his dismissal. 
The Court referred to the authorities in Central Bank of India v. P.S. Rajagopalan (1964) 3 SCR 140 1963 Indlaw SC 136 and M/s Kesoram Cotton Mills Ltd. v. Gangadhar & others (1964) 2 SCR 809 1963 Indlaw SC 49 and distinguished the said cases as the factual background was different. 
"However, it reproduced certain passages from P.S. Rajagopalan 1963 Indlaw SC 136 (supra) because the Court in the said decision has discussed the legislative history of Chapter V-A and Section 33C of the Act and observed that:- "
"In our opinion, on a fair and reasonable construction of sub-section (2) it is clear that if a workman's right to receive the benefit is dispute, that may have to be determined by the Labour Court. 	Precedent
Before proceeding to compute the benefit in terms of money the Labour Court inevitably has to deal with the question as to whether the workman has a right to receive that benefit. 	Precedent
If the said right is not disputed, nothing more needs to be done and the Labour Court can proceed to compute the value of the benefit in terms of money; but if the said right is disputed, the Labour Court must deal with that question and decide whether the workman has the right to receive the benefit as alleged by him and it is only if the Labour Court answers this point in favour of title workman that the next question of making necessary computation can arise. "
"And again, "
"Besides, it seems to us that if the appellant's construction is accepted, it would necessarily mean that it would be at the option of the employer to allow the workman to avail himself of the remedy provided by sub-section (2) because he has merely to raise an objection on the ground that the right claimed by the workman is not admitted to oust the jurisdiction of the Labour Court to entertain the workman's application. 	Precedent
The claim under Section 33-C(2) clearly postulates that the determination of the question about computing the benefit in terms of money may, in some cases, have to be preceded by an enquiry into the existence of the right and such an enquiry must be held to be incidental to the main determination which has been assigned to the Labour Court by sub-section (2). "
"After reproducing the said passages, the Court referred to the authority in U.P. Electric Supply Co. Ltd. v. R.K. Shukla and another AIR 1970 SC 237; 1969 (2) SCC 400 1969 Indlaw SC 135 wherein the Court after review of various decisions had upheld the jurisdiction of the Labour Court to entertain application for lay off-compensation under Section 33C(2) observing that such jurisdiction could not be ousted by a mere plea denying the workman's claim for computation of the benefit in terms of money, adding that the Labour Court had to go into the question and determine whether on the facts it had jurisdiction to make the computation. "
"Thereafter, the Court in Pritam Singh Gill 1972 Indlaw SC 381 (supra) referred to number of decisions and posed the question thus:- "
"The crucial point which requires consideration on the appellant's argument is thus confined to the precise scope and meaning of the word workman"" used in Section 33-C(2) in the background of the definition of this word as contained in Section 2(s)."" "
"Thereafter, it was held:- "
"This section was enacted for the purpose of enabling individual workman to implement, enforce or execute their existing individual rights against their employers without being compelled to have recourse to Section 10 by raising disputes and securing a reference which is obviously a lengthy process. 	Precedent
Section 33-C of the Act has accordingly been described as a provision which clothes the Labour Court with the powers similar to those of an executing court so that the workman concerned receives speedy relief in respect of his existing individual rights. 	Precedent
The primary purpose of the section being to provide the aggrieved workman with a forum similar to the executing courts, it calls for a broad and beneficial construction consistently with other provisions of the Act, which should serve to advance the remedy and to suppress the mischief. 	Precedent
It may appropriately be pointed out that the mischief which Section 33-C was designed to suppress was the difficulties faced by individual workmen in getting relief in respect of their existing rights without having resort to Section 10 of the Act. 	Precedent
To accept the argument of the appellant, it would always be open to an unfair, unsympathetic and unscrupulous employer to terminate the services of his employee in order to deprive him of the benefit conferred by Section 33-C and compel him to have resort to the lengthy procedure by way of reference under Section 10 of the Act thereby defeating the very purpose and object of enacting this provision. 	Precedent
This, in our view, quite clearly brings out the repugnancy visualised in the opening part of Section 2 of the Act and such a position could hardly have been contemplated by the Legislature. 	Precedent
In order to remove this repugnancy Section 33-C(2) must be so construed as to take within its fold a workman, who was employed during the period in respect of which he claims relief, even though he is no longer employed at the time of the application. 	Precedent
In other words the term workman"" as used in Section 33-C(2) includes all persons whose claim, requiring computation under this sub-section, is in respect of an existing right arising from his relationship as an industrial workman with his employer. "
By adopting this construction alone can we advance the remedy and suppress the mischief in accordance with the purpose and object of inserting Section 33-C in the Act. 
"We are, therefore, inclined to agree with the view taken by the Madras decisions and we approve of their approach. "
"According to Shri Malhotra, in cases where there is no dispute about the employee's right which is not denied, he will be entitled to file a suit. "
"Whether or not the right of suit can be claimed by the employee, we are not persuaded on the basis of this argument to accept the construction canvassed on behalf of the appellant and deny to a dismissed employee the benefit of speedy remedy under Section 33-C(2) of the Act."" "
[emphasis supplied] 
"It needs to be noted that after so stating, the three-Judge Bench clarified that its pronouncement was strictly in the context of the Act. "
The Court opined that in the case at hand they were only concerned with the Act and it should not be treated as expression of an opinion as regards the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act. 
"Be it stated immediately, in the case at hand to appreciate the applicability of the provisions contained in Section 33C(2) of the Act, it is necessary to appreciate the benefits available to the employees under the VRS. "
The benefits which are available are reproduced below:- 
The following benefits are payable to the employees covered under the scheme. 
Terminal benefits: 
The following benefits as statutorily due will be paid as per eligibility. 
i. The balance in the P.F. Account payable as per the CPF regulation. 
Cash equivalent of accumulated earned leave as per the rules of the enterprise. 
Gratuity as per the provisions of the Payment of Gratuity Act or other applicable Rules of the Organisation. 
Exgratia Benefits: 
"(i) An employee who is regular or permanent, whose request for VRS is accepted would be entitled to an Ex-gratia payment equivalent to One and Half months emoluments (Pay + DA) last drawn, for each completed year of service or the monthly emoluments at the time of retirement multiplied by the balance months of service left before normal date of retirement whichever is less, subject to a minimum of Rs.30,000/- (Rupees Thirty Thousand only). "
"One month/three months notice pay, as per the service conditions applicable. "
"If the application of an employee opting for VRS is accepted instantaneously and payment is arranged by the management on the same day, the concerned individual would be entitled for payment of ex-gratia along with pay for notice-period. "
"Payment of ex-gratia for services rendered or left over service(whichever is less), as well as the amount payable for the Notice period should, however, not exceed the basic pay + DA that would have been paid to the employee who has opted for VRS till the date of his superannuation. "
"Where the management takes times to take a decision on the acceptance of an application submitted by the employees for VRS and allows the notice period to lapse or the employee concerned has drawn full salary during the notice period served by him, the pay for notice period would not be admissible as the employee has already drawn the salary for the notice period. "
"In addition the Employee and his family would also be entitled to travel fare of the admissible class to his native place within the State of Andhra Pradesh, which will be verified with reference to his L.T.C. file. "
"(ii) For calculation of ex-gratia under the Scheme the fraction of service viz., 6 months and above will be treated as one year and service of less than 6 months will be ignored. "
"(iii) EOL upto a period of one year will be considered for calculation of ex-gratia benefits, provided the Service Regulations of the concerned Organizations permit sanction of such EOL."" "
We need not refer to the other clauses as they do not really provide for any kind of benefit but stipulate the various aspects for implementation of the VRS and the procedure to be adopted. 
"On a perusal of the VRS, it is clear as day that it did not deal with the lay-off compensation. "
"As has been laid down in Pritam Singh Gill 1972 Indlaw SC 381 (supra), a claim pertaining to non-payment of suspension allowance could be agitated under the said provision in spite of the employee being dismissed from service. "
In A.K. Bindal 2003 Indlaw SC 363 (supra) the two-Judge Bench has held that after acceptance of the scheme and availing of benefits under VRS an employee could not claim higher wages. 
The controversy was different. 
"If the VRS had mentioned about the lay-off compensation, needless to say, the claim would have been covered and the amount received by the workmen would have been deemed to have been covered the quantum of lay-off compensation. "
That is not the factual position. 
"Therefore, the controversy that arose in Pritam Singh Gill 1972 Indlaw SC 381 (supra) and the dispute that emanated in A.K. Bindal 2003 Indlaw SC 363 (supra) are quite different. "
"Hence, we are disposed to think that there exists no conflict between Pritam Singh Gill 1972 Indlaw SC 381 (supra) and A.K. Bindal 2003 Indlaw SC 363 (supra). "
"We think it appropriate to say that though there is cessation of relationship between the employee and the employer in VRS but if it does not cover the past dues like lay-off compensation, subsistence allowance, etc., the workman would be entitled to approach the Labour Court under Section 33C(2) of the Act. "
"If it is specifically covered, or the language of VRS would show that it covers the claim under the scheme, no forum will have any jurisdiction. "
"With the aforesaid clarification, we would have directed to list the matter before the two-Judge Bench. "
It is not so required. 
It is noticeable that the claim relating to lay-off compensation is not covered in the VRS. 
"The Labour Court, learned single Judge and the Division Bench have declined to entertain the claim on the ground that they had no jurisdiction to adjudicate the controversy. "
"We have already held that claim pertaining to lay-off compensation having not been part of the VRS, the Labour Court has jurisdiction to adjudicate under Section 33C(2) of the Act. "
"Therefore, we set aside the judgment and order of the High Court and that of the Labour Court. "
"Resultantly, the appeal is allowed, the impugned judgments and orders are set aside and the matter is remitted to the Labour Court for adjudication in accordance with law. "
The Labour Court shall finalise the claim preferred under Section 33C(2) of the Act on its own merits within three months hence. 
"The parties are directed to appear before the Labour Court on 17th October, 2016. "
There shall be no order as to costs. 
Appeal allowed 
Leave granted. 
"The appellant (hereinafter referred to as ""the Management"") is aggrieved by the impugned judgment of the High Court whereby the first respondent (hereinafter referred to as ""the employee"") was directed to be reinstated in service with 50 per cent back wages, reversing the order passed by the Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court. "
"The employee, while working with the Management, submitted a certificate purportedly issued by the Indian Institute of Bankers claiming that she had passed the CAIIB Part-II Examination, and on that basis, started drawing additional monetary benefits. "
"The Disciplinary Authority, based on the finding in a domestic enquiry that the certificate was a forged one, dismissed her from service on 01.08.2003. "
The punishment was upheld by the Appellate Authority vide order dated 10.06.2006. 
The Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court declined to grant any relief. 
"However, the High Court ordered reinstatement with 50 per cent back wages, and thus aggrieved, the Management has filed the appeal. "
"The only ground on which the High Court interfered with the award was that the Management had not established, by leading evidence, that the employee was aware of the fact that the certificate produced before the Management was forged. "
To quote from impugned judgment: 
"The question, therefore, before the Enquiry Officer was whether the petitioner knew at the time of submission of the forged document that it was forged one. "
The Presenting Officer in the domestic enquiry did not lead any evidence to prove the knowledge and it appears that everyone went on presuming that the petitioner knew about the forgery since prior to its production before the employer. 
"Due to the fact that she produced it on the employer's record and that she received monetary benefits because of such production, every one believed that she ought to know that it was a forgery. "
This conclusion of the Enquiry Officer is grossly incorrect because it is based on guess work. 
He could have said that there is strong doubt in his mind that the petitioner knew before hand that the certificate was a forgery. 
"But, he ought to have asked the Presenting Officer to lead further evidence to prove that the petitioner knew that the document she produced was forgery. "
Neither the Presenting Officer realised this gross lacuna in their case. 
"On the basis of this guess and doubt, the enquiry officer held the petitioner guilty of misconduct. "
"This, in my view was grossly incorrect decision."" "
We find it difficult to appreciate the strange stand taken by the High Court. 
The Labour Court had clearly analysed the entire evidence and had come to the conclusion that the employee was fully aware of the forgery. 
The Tribunal took note of the fact that she had produced a copy of the postal receipt of dispatching the certificate from the Institute of Bankers in her evidence but failed to explain the source of the postal receipt. 
It also took note of the fact that the alleged certificate of having passed the examination is dated 04.09.2000. 
"If that be so, there was no occasion for asking for any re-verification of the marks by filing an application dated 08.09.2000. "
"Still further, the Court extensively referred to the reply furnished by the Institute of Bankers and came to the conclusion that the certificate was a forged one. "
To quote from paragraph-10 of the award dated 30.08.2011 passed by the Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court: 
"10. ....The workman has claimed that she received the pass certificates from the Indian Institute of Bankers by registered speed post in her home address and filed the same before the authority. 	Ruling by Lower Court
In support of her claim, she filed an envelope to show that the certificate in question was sent to her in the said envelop by the Indian Institute of Bankers. 	Ruling by Lower Court
However, from by merely filing of the envelope, it cannot be held that the certificate in question was sent by the Institute in question to the workman in the said envelope. 	Ruling by Lower Court
Moreover, there are other suspicious circumstances which create doubt regarding the said claim of the workman. 	Ruling by Lower Court
If the certificate was actually sent in the said envelop by the Indian Institute of Bankers by registered speed post from Mumbai to the workman in her home address, then the receipt granted by the post office for sending the envelop by registered speed post must have been granted to the institute and the institute should have in possession of the same in the office, to keep account of the same, but the workman has also filed the zerox copy of the receipt alongwith of the envelope, to show the date of dispatch of the envelope, but she did not say how she was in possession of the said postal receipt. 	Ruling by Lower Court
It is also pleaded by the workman in the statement of claim that she failed in part II of CAIIB examination and applied for verification of marks visiting in person to CAIIB office at Mumbai and on verification and revaluation, she was declared pass. 	Ruling by Lower Court
In the statement of claim she had not mentioned the date of her visit to CAIIB office. 	Ruling by Lower Court
However, she has filed the zerox copy of the letter, Exhibit W-17 to show that she applied for revaluation of her answer paper and the said letter shows that it was submitted on 18.9.2000. 	Ruling by Lower Court
However, Exhibit W-15, filed by the workman shows that by letter dated 4.9.2000, she was intimated by the Indian Institute of Bankers that she had completed the Associate examination of the Institute and is entitled to receive the relevant certificate. 	Ruling by Lower Court
If the workman had received the intimation of completion of the examination, then there was no question of her applying for revaluation of the examination paper and if she had failed in the examination and she approached the Institute for revaluation of her answer paper on 18.09.2000, then there was no question of the Institute intimating her by letter dated 04.09.2000 regarding her completion of the examination and issuance of the certificate. 	Ruling by Lower Court
So it is clear from the materials produced by the parties in the departmental proceedings that the workman knowingly produced the pass certificate of part II CAIIB examination, which was a fabricated one, for monetary gain on ongoing basis and the findings of the enquiry officer are based on the materials on record and are not perverse..... "
"The evidence led by the employee, as rightly appreciated by the Industrial Tribunal, would clearly show that she had the knowledge that the document she produced was a forged one. "
"Therefore, there was no requirement on the part of the Management to establish whether she had known, at the time of submission of the document, that it was a forged one. "
It is a well-settled principle that the High Court will not re-appreciate the evidence but will only see whether there is evidence in support of the impugned conclusion. 
"The court has to take the evidence as it stands and its only limited jurisdiction is to examine, whether on the evidence, the conclusion could have been arrived at. "
(See - Union of India v. H.C. Goel). 
"In the case of Bank of India and another v. Degala Suryanarayana2 1999 Indlaw SC 866, after referring to H.C. Goel case (supra), this Court held at paragraph-11 :- "
Strict rules of evidence are not applicable to departmental enquiry proceedings. 
The only requirement of law is that the allegation against the delinquent officer must be established by such evidence acting upon which a reasonable person acting reasonably and with objectivity may arrive at a finding upholding the gravamen of the charge against the delinquent officer.
