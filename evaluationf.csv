d1_s1,The Order of the Court was as follows:
d1_s2,"We have heard learned counsel for the petitioner as well as counsel for the, State of West Bengal."
d1_s3,"In our opinion, the detention of the, detenu suffers from great infirmity as pointed out by this Court in Sk."
d1_s4,"Abdul karim and others vs The State of West Bengal 1969 Indlaw SC 262 (Writ Petition no. 327 of 1968 decided on January 31, 1969)."
d1_s5,The petitioner is ordered to be released forthwith.
d1_s6,We shall give our reasons for the release later.
d1_s7,"Ray, J."
d1_s8,The petitioner made an application article 32 of the Constitution requiring the respondent to show cause as to why the petitioner should not be released.
d1_s9,"At the conclusion of the hearing of this petition on 15 October, 1969 we directed the release of the petitioner and stated that the reasons would be given later on."
d1_s10,"We are stating our reasons for the order. 'On 5 June, 1969 the District Magistrate, 24 Parganas, West Bengal made an order section 3(2) of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950 (hereinafter called the Act) for the detention of the petitioner."
d1_s11,"On 7 June, 1969 the petitioner was arrested and on the same day grounds of detention were served on the petitioner."
d1_s12,"On 9 June, 1969 information was given to the State Government."
d1_s13,"On 14 June, 1969 the Governor was pleased to approve the order of detention and on the same day the Governor sent the report to the Central Government section 3(4) of the Act together with the grounds of detention."
d1_s14,"On 23 June, 1969 the petitioner made a representation to the State Government."
d1_s15,"On 1 July, 1969 the State Government placed the case of the petitioner before the Advisory Board section 9 of the Act together with the said representation."
d1_s16,"On 13 August, 1969, the Advisory Board after consideration of the materials placed before it was of the opinion that there was sufficient cause for the detention of the petitioner."
d1_s17,"On 19 August, 1969 the State Government is alleged to have rejected the petitioner's representation."
d1_s18,"By an order dated 26 August, 1969 the Governor was pleased to confirm the order of detention of the petitioner."
d1_s19,"The only contention on behalf of the petitioner was that though the petitioner made the representation on 23 June, 1969 the Government did not consider the said representation with reasonable and proper expedition."
d1_s20,"On behalf of the State of West Bengal it was contended first that the matter was referred to the Advisory Board along with the petitioner's representation and the State Government considered the report of the Advisory Board, and, secondly, the affidavit of Rathindra Nath Sen Gupta affirmed on 19 September, 1969 will show that enquiries were made after the petitioner had made the representation and the Government therefore considered the representation."
d1_s21,The affidavit of Rathindra Nath.
d1_s22,Sen Gupta is of little value.
d1_s23,"The deponent stated first that he caused further enquiries to be made through the Superintendent, I Railway Police after he had received the representation of the petitioner from the State Government, secondly, that the Superintendent."
d1_s24,"Railway Police took a little time to submit a report, thirdly, the deponent after being satisfied about anti social activities of the petitioner informed the State Government on 12 August, 1969 to the effect that he did not recommend the release of the petitioner, and, fourthly, that the State Government on 19 August, 1969 rejected the petitioner's representation."
d1_s25,"There is no affidavit by the Superintendent of Po1ice, Sealdah who is alleged to have made further enquiries."
d1_s26,"One will look in vain into the affidavit of the deponent to find out as to when the deponent entrusted the said enquiry to the Superintendent, Railway Police and further as to what time was taken for enquiry and report."
d1_s27,The Court is entitled to know the time and the steps taken along with the nature of the enquiry.
d1_s28,The importance of the matter lies in the fact that it is a case of preventive detention and the personal liberty of a citizen is under consideration of the State Government.
d1_s29,The State.
d1_s30,"Government is, therefore, bound to give the utmost information to this Court."
d1_s31,The Preventive Detention Act confers powers on the Central Government or the State Government to make an order for detention of a person.
d1_s32,The order of detention can be passed by the District Magistrate or the Additional District Magistrate or the Commissioner of Police or the Collector.
d1_s33,When an order is made by any 'of these officers he shall forthwith report the fact to the State Government to which he is subordinate together with the grounds and no such order shall remain in force for more than 12 days after the making of the order unless it is approved by the State Government.
d1_s34,"The State Government shall, as soon as may be, report the fact to the Central Government."
d1_s35,U/s. 7 of the Act grounds of order of detention are to be disclosed to the persons affected by the order not later than 5 days from the date of detention and the Act further requires to afford the person affected by the order the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order to the appropriate Government.
d1_s36,"In the present petition, we are concerned with the scope and intent of section 7 of the Act in regard to the representation made by the petitioner. section 8 of the Act contemplates constitution of Advisory Boards. section 9 requires the appropriate Government within 30 days from the date of detention to place the grounds and the representation, if any, before the Advisory Board."
d1_s37,"The Advisory Board section 10 is to consider the materials and if the Board considers it essential to hear the person concerned who desires to be heard, the Board will hear the person and make the report."
d1_s38,Section II of the Act states that the Government may confirm the detention order if the Advisory Board gives an opinion to that effect.
d1_s39,U/s. 13 of the Act the State Government may revoke an order passed by its officers and the Central Government may revoke an order made by the State Government.
d1_s40,"Counsel on behalf of the State of West Bengal contended that the matter was referred to the Advisory Board along with the representation of the detenu dated 23 June, 1969 and the State Government on 19 August, 1969 rejected the representation of the petitioner and thus discharged its duty."
d1_s41,This contention has to be examined in the light of article 22 of the Constitution and the provisions of the Act.
d1_s42,There have been five recent decisions of this Court on the provisions of this Act particularly in regard to the right of the detenu to have his representation considered by the appropriate Government and the obligation of the appropriate Government in that behalf.
d1_s43,In Sk.
d1_s44,"Abdul Karim & Ors. vs The State of West Bengal, (1969) 3 S.C R. 479 1969 Indlaw SC 262 this Court held that the appropriate Government could not be said to discharge the obligation merely by forwarding the representation of the detenu to the Advisory Board. article 22 of the Constitution guarantees the right of a detenu to have a proper consideration of the representation by the appropriate authority."
d1_s45,"In the case of Pankaj Kumar Chakravarty & Ors. vs The State of West Bengal, [1970] 1 S.C.R.543 1969 Indlaw SC 128 this Court put in the forefront the distinction between the twin obligations of the appropriate authority sections 7 and 8 of the Act."
d1_s46,The appropriate Government is to consider the representation of the detenu inasmuch as section 7 of the Act speaks of affording the detenu the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order of detention.
d1_s47,The obligation of the appropriate authority to consider the representation of the detenu under section 7 of the Act is entirely independent of any action of the Advisory Board or any consideration by the said Board of the representation of the detenu.
d1_s48,"In the case of Pankaj Kumar Chakrabarty, [1970] 1 S.C.R.543 1969 Indlaw SC 128 this Court observed :"
d1_s49,The peremptory language in cl. 5 of article 22 of the Constitution and section 7 of the Act would not have been necessary if the Board and not the Government had to consider the representation.
d1_s50,There is another reason why the appropriate Government is required to consider on its own the representation of the detenu.
d1_s51,If the consideration of the representation of the detenu by the Board sufficed the Constitutional guarantee section 7 of the Act would be robbed of its content.
d1_s52,"In Pankai Kumar Chakrabarty's case, [1970] 1 S.C.R.543 1969 Indlaw SC 128 this Court emphasised the aspect that the representation was addressed to the Government and not directly to the Advisory Board and it was for the reason that the appropriate authority was to exercise its opinion and judgment in an independent and honest manner."
d1_s53,"It, therefore, follows that the appropriate authority is to consider the representation of the detenu uninfluenced by any opinion or consideration of the Advisory Board."
d1_s54,"In the case of Khairul Haque vs State of West Benga, W.P. no. 246 of 1969 decided on 10 9 1969. this Court observed that ""it is' implicit in the language of article 22 that the appropriate Government, while discharging its duty to consider the representation cannot depend upon the views of the Board on such representation""."
d1_s55,The logic behind this proposition is that the Government should immediately consider the representation of the detenu before sending the matter to the Advisory Board and further that such action will then have the real flavour of independent judgment.
d1_s56,"In the case of Shyamal Chakraborty vs The Commissioner of Police, Calcutta & Anr., [1970] 1 S.C.R. 762 1969 Indlaw SC 132 one of the contentions was that the detenu's representation was not considered by the Government."
d1_s57,"There, the facts were these."
d1_s58,"The detenu was arrested on 13 November, 1968."
d1_s59,"On 6 January, 1969 the Governor was pleased to confirm the order of detention after the Advisory Board had given opinion that there was sufficient cause for detention of the petitioner."
d1_s60,"The detenu thereafter on 13 or 16 January, 1969 made a representation."
d1_s61,"On I April, 1969 the Commissioner of Police informed the Home Department that he did not recommend the release of the petitioner."
d1_s62,"On 28 March, 1969 notice was issued under Article. 32 of the Constitution to the Commissioner of Police and to the State Government to show cause why the petitioner should not be set at liberty."
d1_s63,"It is curious that even when Shayamal's case, [1970] 1 S.C.R. 762 1969 Indlaw SC 132 was heard in this Court on 4 August 1969 the representation of the petitioner could not be traced."
d1_s64,"This, Court did not accept the contention of the petitioner that there was any breach of section 7 of the Act on consideration of the facts that the detenu did not choose to make a representation till after the Advisory Board had dealt with the matter and further that the State Government was in the process of dealing with the representation and the detenu did not state that the grounds of detention were false."
d1_s65,"This Court concluded in the case of Shyamal Chakraborty, [1970] 1 S.C.R. 762 1969 Indlaw SC 132 by stating that the State Government would deal with the representation and pass a suitable order."
d1_s66,"When the present Writ Petition came up for hearing on 30 September, 1969 before the Bench consisting of Sikri, Mitter and Reddy, JJ., the matter was referred for decision by a larger Bench to consider as to what would be the question of period within which the Government could dispose of the representation of the detenu because it was felt that there was an apparent conflict between the cases , of Shyamal Chakraborty, [1970] 1 S.C.R. 762 1969 Indlaw SC 132and Khairul Haque, W.Ps. Nos. 246 f 1969 decided on 10 9 1969."
d1_s67,"In view of the fact that there is a fundamental right of the detenu to have the representation considered by the, appropriate Government such right will be rendered meaningless if the Government will not deal with the matter expeditiously but at its own will and convenience."
d1_s68,"In the case of Khairul Haque W.Ps. Nos. 246 f 1969 decided on 10 9 1969 the petitioner made a representation on 23 June, 1969."
d1_s69,"The Advisory Board made its report on 11 August, 1969."
d1_s70,"On 12 August, 1969, the Governor confirmed the order of detention."
d1_s71,"On 29 August, 1969 the Governor rejected the petitioner's representation."
d1_s72,The delay was not explained in the case.
d1_s73,The disposal of the representation by the Government after the receipt of the Report of the Advisory Board was found by this Court to raise a doubt there whether the Government considered the representation in an independent manner.
d1_s74,This independent consideration by the appropriate Government is implicit in article 22 of the Constitution.
d1_s75,"In the case of Durga Show and Ors., W.Ps. Nos. 198, 205 and 206 of 1969 decided on 2 9 1969. three petitioners were set at liberty."
d1_s76,"There the representation of one detenu was received on 29 May, 1969, and was rejected on II' August, 1969."
d1_s77,"In another case the representation of the detenu was receiver on 18 June. 1969 and was rejected by the Government on 16 August, 1969."
d1_s78,"In the third case the representation of the detenu was received on 28 June, 1969 and was rejected on 14 July, 1969."
d1_s79,"In the case of Durga Show and Ors., W.Ps. Nos. 198, 205 and 206 of 1969 decided on 2 9 1969 the opinion of this Court in the case of Sk."
d1_s80,"Abdul karim, (1969] 3 section C. R. 479 1969 Indlaw SC 262 was restated by emphasising the legal obligation of the appropriate Government to consider the representation of the detenu ""as soon as it is received by it""."
d1_s81,It is established beyond any measure of doubt that the appropriate authority is bound to consider the representation of the detenu as early as possible.
d1_s82,The appropriate Government itself is bound to consider the representation as expeditiously as possible.
d1_s83,The reason for immediate consideration of the representation is too obvious to be stressed.
d1_s84,The personal liberty of a person is at stake.
d1_s85,"Any, delay would not only be an irresponsible act on the part of the appropriate authority but also unconstitutional because the Constitution enshrines the fundamental right of a detenu to have his representation considered and it is imperative that when the liberty of a person is in peril immediate action should be taken by the relevant authorities."
d1_s86,"No definite time can be laid down within which a representation of a detenu should be dealt with save and except that it is a constitutional right of a detenu to, have his representation considered as expeditiously as possible."
d1_s87,"It will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case whether the appropriate Government has disposed of the case as expeditiously as possible for otherwise in words of Shelat, J. who spoke for this Court in the case of Khairul Haque, W.P. no. 246 of 1969 decided on 10 9 1969."
d1_s88,"it is obvious that the obligation to furnish the earliest opportunity to make a representation loses both its purpose and meaning."
d1_s89,"Broadly stated, four principles are to be followed in regard to representation of detenus."
d1_s90,"First, the appropriate authority is bound to give an opportunity to the detenu to make a representation and to consider the representation of the detenu as early as possible."
d1_s91,"Secondly, the consideration of the representation of the detenu by the appropriate authority is entirely independent of any action by the Advisory Board including the consideration of the representation of the detenu by the Advisory Board."
d1_s92,"Thirdly, there should not be any delay in the matter of consideration."
d1_s93,It in true that no hard and fast rule can be laid down as to the measure of time taken by the appropriate authority for consideration but it has to be remembered that the Government has to be vigilant in the governance of the citizens.
d1_s94,A citizen's right raises a correlative duty of the State.
d1_s95,"Fourthly, 'the appropriate Government is to exercise its opinion and judgment on the representation before sending the case along with the detenu's representation to the Advisory Board."
d1_s96,If the appropriate Government will release the detenu the Government will not send the matter to the Advisory Board.
d1_s97,If however the Government will not release the detenu the Government will send the case along with the detenu'S representation to the Advisory Board.
d1_s98,If thereafter the Advisory Board will express an opinion in favour of release of the detenu the Government will release the detenu.
d1_s99,If the Advisory Board will express any opinion against the release of the detenu the Government may still exercise the power to release the detenu.
d1_s100,"In the present case, the State of West Bengal is guilty of infraction of the Constitutional provision not only by inordinate delay of the consideration of the representation but also by putting off the consideration till after the receipt of the opinion of the Advisory Board."
d1_s101,As we have already observed there is no explanation for this inordinate delay.
d1_s102,The Superintendent who made the enquiry did not affirm an affidavit.
d1_s103,The State has given no information as to why this long delay occurred.
d1_s104,"The inescapable conclusion in the present case is that the appropriate authority failed to discharge its constitutional, obligation by inactivity and lack of independent judgment."
d1_s105,"The petition is, therefore, allowed."
d1_s106,The petitioner is set at liberty.
d1_s107,Petition allowed.
d2_s1,Civil Appeals Nos. 2000 2001 of 1969 from the judgment and order of the Kerala High Court are by grant of special leave by this Court filed on the ground that these appeals raise a question of wide general importance.
d2_s2,"This question was thus framed, in a reference made by the Madras Bench of the Income tax Appellate Tribunal section 64(1) of the Estate Duty Act, 1953:"
d2_s3,"Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Appellate Tribunal was correct in law in having included the value of the forest lands in the total value of the Estate for the purpose of Estate Duty ?"
d2_s4,"The assessee had claimed that large tracts of, forest land, covered with wild and natural forest growths, situated in the erstwhile Malabar District, were 'agricultural' lands not liable to estate duty under the Estate Duty Act of 1953 (hereinafter referred to as the Act')."
d2_s5,"According to the Revenue, duty had become leviable on the death of the former owners, Smt."
d2_s6,"Jayalakshmi Devi, who died on 6 3 1954, and Shri Madhava Rajah of Kollengode, who died on 9th May, 1955, each owning 1/13th share in the Tarwad properties on the dates of their deaths."
d2_s7,No question as to the effect of any amendment of the law upon liability of agricultural laud to Estate duty was referred by the Tribunal to the High Court.
d2_s8,"Nevertheless, it seems to have been considered by reason of the general nature of the question referred involving a determination of the correctness of the inclusion of the value of ""forest land in the total value of the estate""."
d2_s9,"We may observe here that the question framed seems to rest on the assumption that the land under consideration was ""forest land""."
d2_s10,"However, the general nature of the question framed and the questions argued and decided by the Appellate Tribunal as well as the High Court indicated that the real contest was about the very nature of the land involved in order to determine whether it was liable to estate duty."
d2_s11,"The High Court had observed that the Tribunal's findings that land, to the extent of 36,857.16 acres, was not agricultural land was ""solely based on the absence of evidence or the assessee's failure to prove that the disputed forest lands are agricultural lands""."
d2_s12,The High Court had also mentioned the basis of this finding relating to two types of land about which it had disagreed with the Appellate Tribunal while agreeing with the Tribunal that 500 acres of rocky land was non agricultural land.
d2_s13,This basis was given by quoting the 'following two passages from the judgment of the Appellate Tribunal:
d2_s14,"(1) According to the valuers, the remaining extent of 15,000 and odd acres out of the first category, has been leased by the assessee from time to time for cutting of timber and fuel wood, and has never been used by him either by himself or through lessees to bring it under cultivation for any purpose."
d2_s15,There is no material on record from which it can be said that this area can at all be brought under cultivation for any purpose.
d2_s16,"Even if it is assumed that, there is a bare possibility of this area being brought under cultivation, the assessee has not placed any material before us from which it can be said that a prudent owner would undertake any process of farming in respect of this land""."
d2_s17,"(2) ""With regard to the second category of the land of the extent of 16,000 and odd acres, the report of the valuers does not throw any light upon the nature of this land, and the only information available is that these lands have been held by the Kerala Government under a perpetual lease on an annual rent of rs. 5,000/ ."
d2_s18,The assessee has not shown whether this land was being cultivated. by the Kerala Government or whether it was Only being exploited by the Kerala Government for its timber value.
d2_s19,"On the material on record, it is not possible for these lands to come. under the category of agricultural lands""."
d2_s20,The High Court had set out the provisions of section 5 of the Act as they stood before a slight amendment in 1956.
d2_s21,It read:
d2_s22,Levy of estate duty
d2_s23,"(1) In the case of every person dying after the commencement of this Act, there shall, save as hereinafter expressly provided, be levied and paid upon the principal value ascertained as hereinafter provided of all property settled or not settled, including agricultural land situate in the States specified in the First Schedule to this Act, which passes on the death of such person, a duty called 'estate duty' at the rates fixed in accordance with section 35."
d2_s24,"(2) The Central Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, and the names of any other States to the First Schedule in respect whereof resolutions have been passed by the Legislatures of those States adopting this Act u/cl. (1) of article 252 of the Constitution in respect of estate duty on agricultural lands situate in those States, and on the issue of any such notification the States so added shall be deemed to be States specified in the First Schedule within the meaning of sub section (1)""."
d2_s25,"After pointing out that agricultural land falls under item 48 of List II or the State List in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, the High Court held that estate duty on the land under consideration would become leviable provided it was agricultural land on the passing of resolutions by the legislature of the State of Madras as provided by section 5 (2) set out above."
d2_s26,"These resolutions having been passed on 2 4 1955, the State of Madras was added in the First Schedule to the Act with effect from 6th June, 1955."
d2_s27,"Hence, the High Court held that the estate duty was not leviable under the Act on agricultural land, before 6th June, 1955, in the Madras State to which the land under consideration had belonged at the time when it was said to have become subject to a levy of estate duty."
d2_s28,"Thus, the principal question which arose was: What is the meaning of ""agricultural land"" as that term is used in the Act ?"
d2_s29,"The High Court of Kerala, which had to deal with this reference decided the question on two grounds: firstly, that, according to the views expressed in Sarojni Devi vs Srikrishna, A.I.R. 1944 Mad. 401 and Megh Raj vs Allah Rakha, A.I.R. 1942 PC 27 and C.I.T. West Bengal, Calcutta, vs Raja Benoy Kumar Sahas Roy, [1957] 32 ITR 466 1957 Indlaw SC 165 the words ""agricultural land"" should be ""interpreted in their widest significance""; and, secondly, that although the burden rested upon an assesee to establish an exemption from liability to estate duty in respect of any part of his estate, yet, if he claimed immunity on the ground that the subject matter does not fall within the ambit of the taxing power of the legislature imposing the duty, the Revenue had to establish that the subject matter involved is taxable."
d2_s30,It then gave its opinion in the following terms:
d2_s31,"It is well known that the extensive areas of different varieties of plantation that we have got in this State were once forest lands, and it is also equally well known that year after year large areas of forest lands in this State are being cleared and converted into valuable plantations."
d2_s32,"In the absence of exceptional circumstances such as the land being entirely rocky or barren for other reasons, all forest lands in this State are agricultural lands in the sense that they can be prudently and profitably exploited for agricultural purposes."
d2_s33,"There is no case that the forest lands concerned in this case or any part thereof are unfit for agricultural exploitation""."
d2_s34,"So far as the correct interpretation of the term ""agricultural laud"" in a taxing statute, such as the one before us, is concerned, we have already dealt with the question in our judgment in Commissioner of Wealth tax, Andhra Pradesh vs Officer in Charge (Court of Wards) Paigah, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 146 1976 Indlaw SC 503 where we have said:"
d2_s35,"We think that it is not correct to give as wide a meaning as possible to terms used in a statute simply because the statute does not define an expression."
d2_s36,The correct rule is that we have to endeavour to find out the exact sense in which the words have been used in a particular context.
d2_s37,We are entitled to look at the statute as a whole and give an interpretation in consonance with the purposes of the statute and what legally follows from the terms used.
d2_s38,We are to avoid absurd results.
d2_s39,"If we were to give the widest possible connotation to the words 'agricultural land', as the Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court seemed inclined to give to the term 'agricultural land', we would reach the conclusion that practically all land, even that covered by buildings is 'agricultural land' is as much as its potential or possible use could be agricultural."
d2_s40,The object of the Wealth Tax Act is to tax surplus wealth.
d2_s41,It is clear that all land is not excluded from the definition of assets.
d2_s42,It is only 'agricultural land' which could be exempted.
d2_s43,"Therefore, it is imperative to give reasonable limits to the scope of the agricultural land', or, in other words, this exemption had to be necessarily given a more restricted meaning than the very wide ambit given to it by the Andhra Pradesh Full Bench""."
d2_s44,"Learned Counsel for the respondents had sought to rely strongly upon State of Kerala & Anr. vs The Gwalior Rayon Silk Manufacturing (Wvg.) Co. Ltd. etc., [1974] (1) S.C.R. p. 671 1973 Indlaw SC 190, 682 where the question under consideration was whether the Kerala Private Forests (Vesting and Assignment) Act 26 of 1971, purporting to acquire forest lands held on Janmam right,' without payment of compensation, for implementing a scheme of agrarian reform by assigning lands or leasing them to poorer sections of rural agricultural population, was acquiring ""agricultural land"", for purposes' stated in. the Preamble to the Act before this Court for interpretation. This Court interpreted the Preamble as having the effect of an earmarking by Legislature of certain forest lands for conversion into land meant for agriculture."
d2_s45,"We do not think that the forest land involved in Gwalior Rayon Silk Manufacturing (Wvg.) Co. Ltds.' case 1973 Indlaw SC 190 (supra), which had become linked up with agricultural purposes and earmarked for them, by reason of a special statute for special purpose can bear comparison with forest land with ""spontaneous"" or natural and wild growths of forest, which is involved in the case now before us."
d2_s46,The decision in Gwalior Rayon Silk Manufacturing (Wvg.) Co.'s case 1973 Indlaw SC 190 (supra) obviously depended upon the special facts of that case and the character of provisions to be interpreted.
d2_s47,"This Court keeping in view the special features of that case, in the context of certain judicial pronouncements mentioned in the statement of objects and reasons for the statute to be interpreted, observed there (at p. 683):"
d2_s48,"It is, therefore, manifest that when the legislature stated in the Preamble that the private forests are agricultural land, they merely wanted to convey that they are lands which by and large could be prudently and profitably exploited for agricultural purposes."
d2_s49,"It seems clear to us that this Court, by explaining why, for certain special reasons and in an unusual context, certain land described as ""forest land"" was to be treated as though it had become ""agricultural"", implied that ordinarily this is not so."
d2_s50,"In Rajah Anand Brahma Shah vs State of U.P. & Ors., [1967] 1 S.C.R. 373 1966 Indlaw SC 54 at p. 379 this Court held forest land to be non arable which meant ""non agricultural""."
d2_s51,"We think that, without evidence to show that such land had been cleared and prepared or earmarked for agricultural purposes, it must be treated as prima facie non agricultural land."
d2_s52,Learned Counsel appearing for the respondent stated before us that the lands under consideration had also been subsequently acquired by the Govt. and put to agricultural uses.
d2_s53,"There is, however, no finding or evidence before us to that effect."
d2_s54,"Apparently, the learned Counsel meant that forest land subsequent to the levy of estate duty had been acquired by the State to be converted and used for agricultural purposes."
d2_s55,"There being no evidence or finding of such a character before the events which attracted the estate duty, we cannot take notice of such a statement by Counsel."
d2_s56,It is irrelevant for the purpose of the cases before us.
d2_s57,"So far as the question of burden of proof is concerned, we think that to proceed on the assumption that all land is prima facie capable of cultivation, so that the State must prove that it is non agricultural in order to establish that it could be the subject matter of legislation which was within Parliament's legislative competence, and, therefore, covered by the Act, is to mix up the question of legislative competence and that of taxability of what is, on the face of it, taxable as part of the estate or property of the assessee within the meaning of section 5 of the Act set out above."
d2_s58,"Indeed, the question of legislative competence of Parliament was neither in issue nor part of the question referred even if such a question could have been referred at all by a Tribunal functioning under the Act."
d2_s59,We think that the burden of establishing the exemption lay upon the assessee respondent as was rightly held by the High Court.
d2_s60,"We think that the High Court was not correct in placing the burden upon the Department, after it was admitted that it was ""forest land"", on the ground that the further question of an immunity of the subject matter from taxation by Parliament arose here and that, therefore, the onus lay on the Department."
d2_s61,"Even if there could be such an onus here, it was, we think, sufficiently discharged by the admission that this was ""forest land"" covered with natural or wild growths."
d2_s62,"After that, at any rate, the assessee had to prove change of its character."
d2_s63,"In Commissioner of Wealth Tax, Andhra Pradesh vs Officer incharge (Court of Wards) Paigah 1976 Indlaw SC 503, (supra), in which we heard arguments together with arguments in the case now before us, we found that there was some evidence of the agricultural character of land in the shape of entries in revenue record."
d2_s64,We do not find what could similarly constitute evidence of agricultural character of the land involved in this case.
d2_s65,"On the other hand, the assessee's admission that the land under consideration was ""forest land"", covered by wild and natural growth of forests, constituted evidence to the contrary."
d2_s66,"We think that, unless there was evidence that such lands had been, in some way, set apart or earmarked for or linked up with an agricultural purpose, by their owners or occupiers, it could not be held that they are agricultural lands."
d2_s67,"We think that the view of the Kerala High Court, that ""all forest lands in this State are agricultural lands in the sense that they can be prudently and profitably exploited for agricultural purposes"", is too wide."
d2_s68,It is erroneous for the reasons we have already set out in our judgment in the case from the Andhra Pradesh High Court.
d2_s69,The question has to be decided on evidence of actual or intended user for which land may have been prepared or set apart.
d2_s70,"In the case before us now, the Tribunal said in its referring order:"
d2_s71,"The Tribunal permitted the accountable person to raise the contention that the value of the forest lands has to be excluded as they were agricultural lands."
d2_s72,"So far as this contention was concerned, the following facts were not in dispute: viz., that the forest consisted of trees of spontaneous growth; that no operations in the nature of forest development were being carried on; and, that only operations in the nature of exploitation of the forest were being conducted."
d2_s73,"The accountable person, however, contended that these lands were capable of being brought under cultivation at a future date and that therefore they must be deemed to be agricultural lands."
d2_s74,Reliance was sought to be placed upon the decision of the Madras High Court in Sarojini Devi vs Shri Krishna (AIR 1944 Madras p. 401) in which it was held that the expression 'agricultural lands' must be taken to include lands which are used or are capable of being used for raising any valuable plants or trees or for any other purpose of husbandry.
d2_s75,"The Tribunal was, however, of the view that in the said decision their Lordships did not intend to lay down a definition of the expression 'agricultural lands' for all purposes, and that, on the other hand, they clearly indicated that the expression admits of different interpretations and that it was only from the context of the particular enactment in which this expression is used that' its meaning has to be inferred."
d2_s76,The Tribunal observed that the very wide definition of the expression 'agricultural lands' laid down in the above cited decision was not applicable to cases under the Estate Duty Act.
d2_s77,"The Tribunal, therefore, negatived the contention of the accountable person that the forest lands had to be excluded from the value of the assessable estate of the deceased""."
d2_s78,"Thus, it is clear that the assessee, after having been given due opportunity to lead evidence to show that what was prima facie non agricultural land, in the sense that it was covered by the spontaneous or natural growth of forests, was really agricultural land, had led no such evidence."
d2_s79,It was not shown that the assessee or his predecessor in interest did anything to develop the forest in the sense that any particular trees were planted deliberately.
d2_s80,It appears that the nature of exploitation of the forest lands was simply to give contracts for cutting of the trees.
d2_s81,"The assessee not having led any evidence of any intention to prepare or appropriate or ear mark the land for any agricultural use or purpose, but', on the other hand, having contended that mere possibility of using such land for agricultural purposes in future was enough, could not be said to have discharged his onus of proof."
d2_s82,"After the assessee's admission that it was ""forest land"" which presumably prevented cultivation, no evidence was led as we have already observed to indicate any change of character of this land or its conversion into agricultural land."
d2_s83,We therefore think that the Appellate Tribunal was correct in expressing the view it had taken and the conclusions it had recorded.
d2_s84,"And, no case is made out for sending the case back to the Tribunal for any fresh decision."
d2_s85,"Consequently, we allow these appeals, set aside the judgment and orders of the High Court."
d2_s86,The parties will bear their own costs.
d3_s1,"Mrs. Frances Coralie Mullin, a British National was served on November 23, 1979, with an order of detention under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act."
d3_s2,The grounds of detention were also served on her on the same day.
d3_s3,"On December 1, 1979, her Advocate sent a telegram to the detaining authority, namely, the Administrator, Union Territory of Delhi, asking for copies of statements and documents upon which reliance was placed in the grounds of detention."
d3_s4,"The telegram was received by the detaining authority on December 3, 1979."
d3_s5,"The Director of Revenue Intelligence who was directed by the Administrator, Union Territory of Delhi, to supply copies of statements and documents to the detenu, so supplied them on December 7, 1979."
d3_s6,Seventeen documents were mentioned in the accompanying letter.
d3_s7,"Alleging that one of the documents (item no. 14) was not sent, the Advocate wrote a letter by Registered post on December 17, 1979, asking for a copy of that document also."
d3_s8,"A reply was sent on January 1, 1980, to the effect that document no. 14 had also been supplied earlier but nonetheless another copy of the same document was being sent again."
d3_s9,"On December 22, 1979, the detenu made a representation to the detaining authority and it was actually received by the latter on December 26, 1979."
d3_s10,The Home Department of the Delhi Administration forwarded a copy of the representation to the Customs authorities for their remarks.
d3_s11,"The remarks were received on January 4, 1980."
d3_s12,"Thereafter the representation was considered and rejected by the Administrator on January 15, 1980."
d3_s13,"The rejection of the representation was communicated to the detenu on January 17, 1980."
d3_s14,"In the meanwhile the Advisory Board to whom the detention of the petitioner had been referred met on January 4, 1980 and considered the matter."
d3_s15,The detenu was produced before the Advisory Board and various concerned Departmental officials were also present.
d3_s16,"On January 10, 1980, the Advisory Board recorded its opinion and forwarded the same to the detaining authority."
d3_s17,"It was received by the Home Department of the Delhi Administration on January 11, 1980 but was actually placed before the Administrator on January 19, 1980 when the detaining authority confirmed the order of detention."
d3_s18,"In this application for the issue of a writ of Habeas Corpus three submissions were made by Shri Ram Jethmalani, learned counsel for the petitioner :"
d3_s19,"The representation of the detenu, made on December 22, 1979, was not communicated to the Advisory Board as it ought to have been, when the Board met on January 4,1980."
d3_s20,The detaining authority should have disposed of the representation before forwarding it to the Advisory Board.
d3_s21,"Even if the detaining authority did forward it to the Advisory Board, the detaining authority should not have awaited the hearing before the Advisory Board and should not have allowed itself to be influenced by such hearing."
d3_s22,There was inexcusable delay in enabling the detenu to make a representation and indisposing of the representation.
d3_s23,"Notwithstanding the clear assertion in the additional grounds raised by the petitioner, which she was allowed to do by an order of the Court, that her representation dated December 22, 1979, was not placed before the Advisory Board when the Board met on January 4, 1980, there was no specific denial of the assertion in the counter filed by the Delhi Administration to the additional grounds."
d3_s24,"However, we were informed by Shri Abdul Khader, learned Counsel for the Delhi Administration, that the representation was in fact forwarded to the Advisory Board and also considered by the latter."
d3_s25,He produced the relevant files before us which we also permitted Shri Jethmalani to inspect.
d3_s26,We are satisfied that the representation was forwarded to the Advisory Board and it was also considered by the latter.
d3_s27,"There is, therefore, no force in the first submission made on behalf of the petitioner."
d3_s28,"We wish to repeat here, what we have said on earlier occasions, that there should be greater precision and perspicuity in affidavits filed into Court."
d3_s29,Care and clarity are particularly important when the Court is concerned with questions of personal freedom.
d3_s30,"In support of the second and third submissions, reliance was placed by the learned counsel for the petitioner on the four principles laid down by this Court in Jayanarayan Sukul vs State of West Bengal 1969 Indlaw SC 445, and on the observations of the Court in Nareendra Purshotam Umrao etc. vs B. B. Gujaral & Ors. 1978 Indlaw SC 272 and Ramchandra A. Kamat vs Union of India & Ors 1980 Indlaw SC 122."
d3_s31,In the first case a Constitution bench of the Court laid down four broad principles to be followed in regard to representation of detenus :
d3_s32,"First, the appropriate authority is bound to give an opportunity to the detenu to make a representation and to consider the representation of the detenu as early as possible."
d3_s33,"Secondly, the consideration of the representation of the detenu by the appropriate authority is entirely independent of any action by the Advisory Board including the consideration of the representation of the detenu by the Advisory Board."
d3_s34,"Thirdly, there should not be any delay in the matter of consideration."
d3_s35,It is true that no hard and fast rule can be laid down as to the measure of time taken by the appropriate authority for consideration but it has to be remembered that the Government has to be vigilant in the governance of the citizens.
d3_s36,A citizen's right raises a correlative duty of the State.
d3_s37,"Fourthly, the appropriate Government is to exercise its opinion and judgment on the representation before sending the case along with the detenu's representation to the Advisory Board."
d3_s38,If the appropriate Government will release the detenu the Government will not send the matter to the Advisory Board.
d3_s39,"If, however, the Government will not release the detenu the Government will send the case alongwith the detenu's representation to the Advisory Board."
d3_s40,If thereafter the Advisory Board will express an opinion in favour of release of the detenu the Government will release the detenu.
d3_s41,"If the Advisory Board will express any opinion against the release of the detenu the Government may still exercise the power to release the detenu."""
d3_s42,"In the second case, to the facts of which we will refer later, the observations upon which reliance was placed were :"
d3_s43,"It is urged that the Government was under a constitutional obligation to consider the representations before the hearing before the Advisory Board."
d3_s44,There is no quarrel with the principle but the difficulty is about the application of the principle on the facts an circumstances of the present case.
d3_s45,"In fact, the Government has to reach its decision uninfluenced by the opinion of the Advisory Board."""
d3_s46,"In the third case, offer of inspection of documents twelve days after request for copies was considered fatal to the detention and it was observed :"
d3_s47,"""If there is undue delay in furnishing the statements and documents referred to in the grounds of detention the right to make effective representation is denied."
d3_s48,The detention cannot be said to be according to the procedure prescribed by law.
d3_s49,"When the Act contemplates the furnishing of grounds of detention ordinarily within five days of the order of detention the intention is clear that the statements and documents which are referred to in the grounds of detention and which are required by the detenu and are expected to be in possession of the detaining authority should be furnished with reasonable expedition."""
d3_s50,We have no doubt in our minds about the role of the Court in cases of preventive detention : it has to be one of eternal vigilance.
d3_s51,No freedom is higher than personal freedom and no duty higher than to maintain it unimpaired.
d3_s52,The Court's writ is the ultimate insurance against illegal detention.
d3_s53,The Constitution enjoins conformance with the provisions of article 22 and the Court exacts compliance. article 22(5) vests in the detenu the right to be provided with an opportunity to make a represntation.
d3_s54,Here the Law Reports tell a story and teach a lesson.
d3_s55,"It is that the principal enemy of the detenu and his right to make a representation is neither high handedness nor mean mindedness but the casual indifference, the mindless in sensibility, the routine and the red tape of the bureaucratic machine."
d3_s56,"The four principles enunciated by the Court in Jayanarayan Sukul vs State of West Bengal 1969 Indlaw SC 445 (supra) as well as other principles enunciated in other cases, an analysis will show, are aimed at shielding personal freedom against indifference, insensibility, routine and red tape and thus to secure to the detenu the right to make an effective representation."
d3_s57,We agree :
d3_s58,"(1) the detaining authority must provide the detenu a very early opportunity to make a representation,"
d3_s59,"(2) the detaining authority must consider the representation as soon as possible, and this, preferably, must be before the representation is forwarded to the Advisory Board,"
d3_s60,"(3) the representation must be forwarded to the Advisory Board before the Board makes its report, and"
d3_s61,"(4) the consideration by the detaining authority of the representation must be entirely independent of the hearing by the Board or its report, expedition being essential at every stage."
d3_s62,"We, however, hasten to add that the time imperative can never be absolute or obsessive."
d3_s63,The Court's observations are not to be so understood.
d3_s64,"There has to be lee way, depending on the necessities (we refrain from using the word 'circumstances') of the case."
d3_s65,"One may well imagine, a case where a detenu does not make a representation before the Board makes its report making it impossible for the detaining authority either to consider it or to forward it to the Board in time or a case where a detenu makes a representation to the detaining authority so shortly before the Advisory Board takes up the reference that the detaining authority cannot consider the representation before then but may merely forward it to the Board without himself considering it."
d3_s66,Several such situations may arise compelling departure from the time imperative.
d3_s67,But no allowance can be made for lethargic indifference.
d3_s68,No allowance can be made for needless procrastination.
d3_s69,"But, allowance must surely be made for necessary consultation where legal intricacies and factual ramifications are involved."
d3_s70,The burden of explaining the necessity for the slightest departure from the timeimperative is on the detaining authority.
d3_s71,"We notice that in Narendra Purshotam Umarao etc. vs B. B. Gujral & Ors 1978 Indlaw SC 272. (supra) the detenu made his representation on 4th and 6th of March 1978, the Advisory Board gave a hearing on 13th March and the detaining authority rejected the representation on 18th March."
d3_s72,The Court perused the records of the Government and the Advisory Board and concluded that there was no infraction of the Constitutional safeguard in article 22(5).
d3_s73,"It was held, with reference to the records, that the Government had taken a decision uninfluenced by what transpired at the hearing before the Board."
d3_s74,The matter was found to have been dealt with by the government at all levels and the detaining authority had come to an independent conclusion of his own by applying his mind to the facts and circumstances of the case.
d3_s75,We have already expressed our agreement with the four principles enunciated in Jayanarayan Sukul vs State of West Bengal 1969 Indlaw SC 445 (supra).
d3_s76,We would make one observation.
d3_s77,"When it was said there that the Government should come to its decision on the representation before the Government forwarded the representation to the Advisory Board, the emphasis was not on the point of time but on the requirement that the Government should consider the representation independently of the Board."
d3_s78,This was explained in Nagendra Nath Mondal vs the State of West Bengal 1972 Indlaw SC 401.
d3_s79,In Sukul's case 1969 Indlaw SC 445 (supra) the Court also made certain pertinent observations :
d3_s80,"No definite time can be laid down within which a representation of a detenu should be dealt with save and except that it is a constitutional right of a detenu to have his representation considered as expeditiously as possible."
d3_s81,It will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case whether the appropriate Government has disposed of the case as expeditiously as possible. . . .
d3_s82,In Prabhakar Shankar Dhuri vs section section Pradhan 1970 Indlaw SC 383 and Kantilal Bose vs State of West Bengal 1972 Indlaw SC 546 delay of 16 days and 28 days respectively in disposing of the representation of the detenu was considered sufficient to vitiate the detention.
d3_s83,"On the other hand, in Nagendra Nath Mondal vs the State of West Bengal1972 Indlaw SC 401, a delay of 34 days was held not to affect the validity of the detention as part of the delay was explained by the circumstance that the records of the case had been sent to the Advisory Board and part of the delay was explained by the enquiries which the Government had to make."
d3_s84,The Court observed :
d3_s85,"That fact is not disputed before us and so also the fact that those records showed that on June 7, 1971, Government had sent the files in connection with the petitioner's case and his representation to the Advisory Board."
d3_s86,"As soon as the representation was returned to it, Government considered it and rejected it but that was before the Board made its report and sent it to Government."
d3_s87,"But counsel urged that this fact may explain the lapse of time from the date that the records were sent and the date when they were returned, but not the delay between May 27, 1971 and June 7, 1971, during which Government could have arrived at its decision."
d3_s88,"That argument has not much force, because in a given case Government may not be able to reach a proper conclusion within a short time especially, in a case where another authority, in this case the District Magistrate, has passed the questioned order."
d3_s89,"It might have to make inquiries as to the situation in the locality, the nature of and the circumstances in which detention was found necessary, the previous history of the person detained etc."
d3_s90,"Therefore, it is difficult to agree with counsel that Government should have reached its conclusion during the said period. . .There can be no hard and fast rule with regard to the time which Government can or should take, and that each case must be decided on its own facts."""
d3_s91,We may now consider whether the facts here disclose a disregard to the petitioner's constitutional right as claimed by his counsel in his second and third submissions.
d3_s92,"The petitioner's request for copies of statements and documents was received by the detaining authority on December 3, 1979, and at the instance of the detaining authority, the Director of Revenue Intelligence furnished the copies sought on December 7, 1979."
d3_s93,The authorities who laid the information before the detaining authority and who were primarily concerned in the matter were the Customs authorities via the Director of Revenue Intelligence.
d3_s94,So the detaining authority directed the Director of Revenue Intelligence to furnish copies of the documents and it was so done.
d3_s95,There was no delay in furnishing of documents and no legitimate complaint could be made on that score.
d3_s96,"The detenu's representation was received by the detaining authority on December 26, 1979."
d3_s97,Without any loss of time copy of the representation was sent to the Customs authorities for their remarks.
d3_s98,That was obviously necessary because the information leading to the order of detention was laid by the Customs authorities.
d3_s99,The facts were undoubtedly complex since the allegations against the detenu revealed an involvement with an international gang of dope smugglers.
d3_s100,"The comments of the Customs authorities were received on January 4, 1980."
d3_s101,"The Advisory Board was meeting on January 4, 1980 and so there could be no question of the detaining authority considering the representation of the detenu before the Board met, unless it was done in great and undue haste."
d3_s102,"After obtaining the comments of the Customs authorities, it was found necessary to take legal advice as the representation posed many legal and constitutional questions."
d3_s103,"So, after consultation with the Secretary (Law and Judicial) Delhi Administration, the representation was finally rejected by the Administrator on January 15, 1980."
d3_s104,These facts are stated in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the Delhi Administration and are substantiated by the records produced before us.
d3_s105,"If there appeared to be any delay, it was not due to any want of care but because the representation required a thorough examination in consultation with investigators of fact and advisers on law."
d3_s106,"We have ourselves examined the records and we find that though the Administrator considered the representation of the detenu after the hearing by the Board, the Administrator was entirely uninfluenced by the hearing before the Board."
d3_s107,The application for the issue of a Writ of Habeas Corpus is therefore dismissed.
d3_s108,Petition dismissed.
d4_s1,We grant special leave and proced to hear the apeal.
d4_s2,"The appellant, Abdul Latif Wahab Sheikh, was in jail from November 12, 1985 onwards awaiting trial on a charge of murder."
d4_s3,"He was acquitted on May 26, 1986."
d4_s4,"Though acquitted, he was not straightaway released from prison."
d4_s5,The reasons are not clear to us from the record.
d4_s6,Presumably he was required in connection with some other case.
d4_s7,"He was due for release from prison on June 23, 1986."
d4_s8,"On that day, however, an order for his detention was made under the provisions of the Gujarat Prevention of Anti Social Activities Act, 1985."
d4_s9,"The mandate of article 22(4) of the Constitution is that no law providing for preventive detention shall authorise the detention of a person for a longer period than three months unless an Advisory Board consisting of persons who are, or have been, or are qualified to be appointed as, Judges of a High Court, has reported before the expiration of the said period of three months that there is in its opinion sufficient cause for such detention. section 10 of the Gujarat Prevention of Anti Social Activities Act, 1985 provides for the Constitution of an Advisory Board, sec. 11 provides for reference to the Advisory Board and sec. 12 prescribes the procedure to be followed by the Advisory Board."
d4_s10,"What is important for the purposes of this case is that sec. 11 stipulates that in every case where a detention order has been made under the Act, the State Government shall, within three weeks from the date of detention of a person under the order, place before the Advisory Board the grounds on which the order has been made, the representation, if any, made by the detenu and the report, if any, of the authorised officer."
d4_s11,"What is intriguing in the case is that on the date when the detention order was made, there was no Advisory Board in existence to which a reference could be made under sec. 11 of the Act and whose report of its opinion regarding sufficient cause for the detention was required to be obtained within three months of the detention under article 22(4) of the Constitution."
d4_s12,"The period of three weeks stipulated by sec. 11 of the Act expired on July 14, 1986."
d4_s13,"The petitioner was entitled to be released on July 14, 1986 as no reference had been made to the Advisory Board within the period contemplated by sec. 11 of the Act."
d4_s14,But he was not so released.
d4_s15,"This state of affairs continued till August 7, 1986 when the order of detention dated June 23, 1986 was revoked and a fresh order of detention was made on the same facts on the same day."
d4_s16,"In the meanwhile, the order of detention dated June 23, 1986 had been challenged by filing a writ petition in the High Court."
d4_s17,"Consequent on the revocation of that order that writ petition was withdrawn as having become infructuous and another writ petition, out of which the present appeal arises, was filed questioning the second order of detention dated August 7, 1986."
d4_s18,"The Advisory Board was constituted on August 18, 1986."
d4_s19,"Reference to the Advisory Board was made on August 20, 1986."
d4_s20,"The Advisory Board made its report on September 26, 1986."
d4_s21,"It will be seen that the report of the Advisory Board was more than three weeks after the detention which commenced on the making of the order of detention, though it was within three months from the date of the second order of detention."
d4_s22,"The learned counsel for the appellant contends that there has been a contravention of the Constitutional protection afforded by article 22(4) and therefore, the appellant is entitled to be set at liberty."
d4_s23,"He does not dispute that under sec. 15(2) of the Gujarat Prevention of Anti Social Activities Act the expiry or revocation of an earlier detention order shall not bar the making of a subsequent detention order under the Act against the same person, subject to the proviso that if there were no fresh facts, the maximum period for which a person may be detained shall not extend beyond the expiry of a period of 12 months from the date of detention under the earlier detention order."
d4_s24,"He submits that this provision, if to be sustained, as constitutionally valid, must be read down so that it does not offend the mandate of article 22(4) of the Constitution that no law providing for preventive detention shall authorise the detention of a person for a longer period than three months unless the Advisory Board has reported within the period of three months that there is in its opinion sufficient cause for such detention."
d4_s25,"On the other hand, the learned counsel for the State of Gujarat submits that it is enough if the report of the Advisory Board is obtained within three months of the subsequent order of detention, where the earlier order is revoked and a subsequent order is made."
d4_s26,"The real question for consideration is whether a law may be made providing for successive orders for detention in a manner as to render the protection of article 22(4) of the Constitution ineffective? For example, can a fresh order of detention be made every 89th day making it unnecessary to obtain the report of the Advisory Board within three months of the detention? That is what it will amount to if the submission of he learned counsel for the State is accepted."
d4_s27,"It, therefore, becomes imperative to read down sec. 15 of the Gujarat Prevention of Anti Social Activities Act, 1985 which provides for the making of successive of order of detention so as to bring it in conformity with article 22(4) of Constitution."
d4_s28,"If there is to be a collision between article 22(4) of the Constitution and sec. 15 of the Act, sec. 15 has to yield."
d4_s29,"But by reading down the provision, the collision may be avoided and sec. 15 may be sustained."
d4_s30,"So, avoiding the collision course, we held that if the report of the Advisory Board is not made within three months of the date of detention, the detention becomes illegal notwithstanding that it is within three months from the date of the second order of detention."
d4_s31,"The learned counsel for the petitioner invited our attention to the decision of the court in Shibapada Mukherjee vs State of West Bengal, [1974] 3 SCC 50 1972 Indlaw SC 646, where the court referring to cls. 4 and 7 of article 22 observed."
d4_s32,"It is clear from cls. (4) and (7) of article 22 that the policy of article 22 is, except where there is a Central Act to the contrary passed u/cl. (7) (a), to permit detention for a period of three months only, and detention in excess of that period is permissible only in those cases where an Advisory Board set up under the relevant statute, has reported as to the sufficiency of the cause for such detention."
d4_s33,"Obviously, the Constitution looks upon preventive detention with disfavour and has permitted it only for a limited period of three months without the intervention of an independent body with persons on it of judicial qualifications of a high order."
d4_s34,"The facts that the report of such an Advisory Board has to be obtained before the expiry of three months from the date of detention shows that the maximum period within which the detaining authority can on its own satisfaction detain a person is three months The observation of the court to the extent that they go to support the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant, but we must say that in that case, the court was not confronted with the present situation at all."
d4_s35,"The learned counsel for the State referred us to A.K. Roy vs Union of India, [1982] 1 SCC 271 1981 Indlaw SC 381, where the court referring to an argument based on sec. 11(2) of the National Security Act said:"
d4_s36,"section 11(2) of the Act provides specifically that the report of the Advisory Board shall specify its opinion as to whether or not there is sufficient cause for the detention of the person concerned""."
d4_s37,This implies that the question to which the Advisory Board has to apply its mind is whether on the date of its report there is sufficient cause for the detention of the person.
d4_s38,"That inquiry necessary involves the consideration of the question as to whether there was sufficient cause for the detention of the person when the order of the detention was passed, but we see no justification for extending the jurisdiction of the Advisory Board to the consideration of the question as to whether it is necessary to continue the detention of the person beyond the date on which its report or beyond the period of three months after the date of detention."""
d4_s39,"The learned counsel for the State also invited our attention to the decision of a learned single Judge of this Court, rendered during the vacation, in Talib Hussain vs State of Jummu & Kashmir, [1971] 3 SCC 118 1970 Indlaw SC 485, where he observed:"
d4_s40,"In regard to the submission that the petitioner was arrested and deprived of his person liberty long before the order of his arrest and this invalidated his detention, it is sufficient to point out that in habeas corpus proceeding the Court has to consider the legality of the detention on the date of hearing. 'If on the date of hearing it cannot be said that the aggrieved party has been wrongfully deprived of his personal liberty and his detention is contrary to law a writ of habeas corpus cannot issue."
d4_s41,Neither of the cases cited by the learned counsel for the State deal with the question now at issue even in a remote way.
d4_s42,They do not have any application.
d4_s43,"We only desire to add that in a habeas corpus proceeding, it is not a sufficient answer to say that the procedural requirements of the Constitution and the statute have been complied with before the date of hearing and therefore, the detention should be upheld."
d4_s44,The procedural requirements are the only safeguards available to a detenu since the court is not expected to go behind the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority.
d4_s45,"The procedural requirements are, therefore, to be strictly complied with if any value is to be attached to the liberty of the subject and the Constitutional rights guaranteed to him in that regard."
d4_s46,"If a reference to an Advisory Board is to be made within three weeks, it is no answer to say that the reference, though not made within three weeks, was made before the hearing of the case."
d4_s47,"If the report of the advisory Board is to be obtained within three months, it is no answer to say that the report though not obtained within three months, was obtained before the hearing of the case."
d4_s48,"If the representation made by the detenu is required to be disposed of within a stipulated period, it is not answer to say that the representation, though not disposed of within three months, was disposed of before the hearing of the case."
d4_s49,"We mentioned that we were intrigued that an order of detention should have been made, knowing full well that there was no Advisory Board in existence to whom a reference could be made under the Act and whose report could be obtained as required by the Constitution."
d4_s50,Such a casual and indifferent approach betrays a disregard for the rights of citizens and this has to be deprecated.
d4_s51,"We have no option but to allow the appeal and quash the order of detention dated August 7, 1986."
d4_s52,The petitioner is now on parole.
d4_s53,He need not surrender to his parole.
d4_s54,"In the view that we have taken, we have refrained from referring to the other submissions of the learned counsel for the appellant."
d5_s1,"This is a petition article 32 of the Constitution filed by one Madhu Mehta, who is the National Convenor of Hindustani Andolan."
d5_s2,"This petition seeks a writ of Habeas Corpus or an appropriate direction with regard to one Shri Gyasi Ram, S/o Shri Param aged above 60 years, who, it is claimed, has been waiting decision on his Mercy Petition pending before the President of India for about 8 or 9 years."
d5_s3,"The said Gyasi Ram was at all relevant time lodged in ""DEATH CELL, CENTRAL JAIL"" JHANSI having been convicted for an offence punishable section 302 of Indian Penal Code and sentenced to death by the learned Sessions Judge, Jhansi on 19 October 1978."
d5_s4,"It appears that Gyasi Ram was convicted and sentenced to death by the learned Sessions Judge, Jhansi on 19 October 1978 for committing murder, which has been described by the UnderSecretary (Judicial), Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India, as the 'cold blooded murder' of a Government servant, namely, Bhagwan Singh, who was the resident of Mauranipur Tehsil, in District Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh."
d5_s5,There then were arrears of land revenue due from Gyasi Ram and also one Mool Chand.
d5_s6,"For the purpose of realising the said arrears of land revenue, their property was attached by Amin Bhagwan Singh and the same was put to sale by auction."
d5_s7,"The auction took place on 26 December 1976 and after the auction while the said Amin was returning along with his Peon Sripat from village Kakwara after delivering the sale certificate to the auction purchaser, they were way laid by Daya Ram (son of Mool Chand) and Gyasi Ram, the convicts involved in this case."
d5_s8,"In the evidence, it was stated that Daya Ram who was armed with pistol fired at the deceased Amin Bhagwan Singh who fell down from his cycle."
d5_s9,"While Daya Ram held down Amin Bhagwan Singh, Gyasi Ram, the person about whom this petition is concerned, cut Bhagwan Singh's throat with the sword he was carrying and inflicted other injuries also."
d5_s10,"After this incident, both Daya Ram and Gyasi Ram, it has been stated, escaped."
d5_s11,"Gyasi Ram was, however, arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced to death, as mentioned hereinbefore."
d5_s12,The death sentence was passed on Gyasi Ram by the learned Sessions Judge on 19 October 1976.
d5_s13,The Allahabad High Court confirmed this death sentenced on 28 February 1979.
d5_s14,This Court dismissed his Cr.
d5_s15,A. no. 362/79 on 17 March 1981.
d5_s16,Mercy Petition was filed by the wife of the convicted to the President of India on 18 December 1981.
d5_s17,It appears that Mercy Petition has still not been disposed of.
d5_s18,Daya Ram had absconded and could not be put on trial along with Gyasi Ram.
d5_s19,"It appears further that Gyasi Ram's Mercy Petitions Dt. 6th October,1981 and 26 November 1981 were rejected by the Governor of Uttar Pradesh on the 26 November 1981 and were received in the Ministry of Home Affairs on the 5 December 1981 for the consideration of the President of India."
d5_s20,"From the affidavit filed on behalf of the Government of India, it appears that after processing the case, the matter was put up before the President of India on 21 April 1983 for his orders on the Mercy Petitions and that the President after examining the case file, returned the file on 30 July 1983 for further consideration."
d5_s21,"While the Ministry of Home Affairs was processing the case of Gyasi Ram further, the intimation was received from this Court on 13 November 1984 that Daya Ram, son of Mool Chand had also filed a S.L.P. against the judgment date 17 October 1984 of the Allahabad High Court by which the sentence of death was confirmed on him."
d5_s22,It appears from the order of this Court Dt. 18 February 1985 dismissing Daya Ram's S.L.P. that this Daya Ram was the same person who was Gyasi Ram's partner in the crime as mentioned hereinbefore.
d5_s23,"Subsequently, .two"
d5_s24,Mercy Petitions were filed on behalf of Daya Ram which were forwarded for the consideration of the Governor of Uttar Pradesh in the first instance by the Ministry of Home Affairs Dt. 9 April 1984 and 9 August 1985 respectively.
d5_s25,These still remain undisposed of.
d5_s26,It has been asserted on behalf of the Government of India in the half yearly return Dt. 8 August 1985 submitted by the Government of Uttar Pradesh that it was reported that they had received a Mercy Petition from Daya Ram.
d5_s27,"Thereafter, in successive half yearly reports, the last of these being Dt. 16 January 1989, the State Government had been saying that the Mercy Petition of Daya Ram was still under consideration."
d5_s28,"It is the version of the Government that in view of the implications of Daya Ram and Gyasi Ram in the same crime, it was considered, it is stated, that the decision on the Mercy Petition of Daya Ram by the Governor of Uttar Pradesh would have a direct bearing on the consideration of the Mercy Petition of Gyasi Ram by the President of India."
d5_s29,"It was, accordingly, felt, so it is .asserted, that it was desirable to await the decision of the Governor of Uttar Pradesh on Daya Ram's Mercy Petition."
d5_s30,"But it was only on 18 January 1989 that by a Wireless Message, the Central Government asked the State Government to let the Ministry of Home Affairs know the decision of the Governor on Daya Ram's Mercy Petition and to send it immediately for consideration of the President of India so that the cases of Gyasi Ram and Daya Ram could be submitted together to the President."
d5_s31,But the Government did not move.
d5_s32,It is further stated that in reply to the Wireless Message of 18 January 1989 the State Government through its letter Dt. 1 February 1989 intimated that the Mercy Petition of Daya Ram was still under consideration.
d5_s33,"Thereafter, there was another request to the Chief Secretary by demi official letter of the Ministry of Home Affairs Dt. 3rd February, 1989 to expedite consideration of Daya Ram's Mercy Petition."
d5_s34,"And upon this, it is stated that by a telex message Dt. 15 March 1989, the State Government had intimated that the Governor of Uttar Pradesh had rejected the Mercy Petition and that formal letter of State Government would follow."
d5_s35,It was stated on behalf of the Government of India that Mercy Petition of Daya Ram was received by the Ministry of Home Affairs on 21 March 1989 along with the letter.
d5_s36,"In the affidavit, it is stated that after collecting certain further information from the Supreme Court Registry, the Ministry of Home Affairs ""was now ready to process the Mercy Petitions of Gyasi Ram and Daya Ram and submit the same to the President of India for consideration""."
d5_s37,The deponent was good enough to state in the affidavit that the delay factor would be kept in view while taking a final decision in the case of Gyasi Ram and he was fully aware of the agony of Gyasi Ram and members of his family.
d5_s38,"It was stated that in view of the reasons stated above, it was not possible to avoid the delay."
d5_s39,"The learned District and Sessions Judge, Jhansi had, in the meantime, visited the said convict Gyasi Ram in jail on 22 May 1988 and had sent a report to the Inspector General of Prisons stating ""Gyasi's mental state is such that he might commit suicide by hanging his head on the iron grill of his cell if a decision on his petition is not taken soon."
d5_s40,"If he is to be hanged, it should be done without any delay or he should be released""."
d5_s41,The Inspector General's Office further sent an official to Delhi to expedite the case.
d5_s42,"Thereafter, this petition was filed for the condemned prisoner."
d5_s43,"Gyasi Ram, until the orders of this Court passed in these proceedings on the 3rd May, 1989, was kept in the Death Cell and it is only pursuant to the orders of this Court that the prisoner was allowed to stay in the Ordinary Cell during the day time."
d5_s44,The petitioner moved this Court on 11 April 1989 and the notice was issued returnable on 19 April 1989.
d5_s45,"Time was taken to file affidavit and the order of this Court Dt. 3rd May, 1989 was passed."
d5_s46,The matter was adjourned for three months.
d5_s47,Affidavits have been filed but his Mercy Petition still remains undisposed of.
d5_s48,"The question is: what is to be done? This question of delay in these matters has been examined by this Court from time to time, and how far delay in execution of death sentence necessitates the commutation of the death sentence or release of the condemned prisoner, has been a matter of some controversy and debate."
d5_s49,"In T.V. Vatheeswaran vs State of Tamil Nadu, [1983] 2 SCR 348 1983 Indlaw SC 441, a bench of two learned Judges considered this 780 aspect."
d5_s50,"Speaking for this Court, Chinnappa Reddy, J. stated in that decision that article 21 of the Constitution enjoins that any procedure, which deprives a person of his life or liberty must be just, fair and reasonable."
d5_s51,"It implies humane conditions of detention, preventive or punitive. 'Procedure established by law' does not end with the pronouncement of sentence; it includes the carrying out of sentence."
d5_s52,"Prolonged detention to await the execution of a sentence of death is an unjust, unfair and unreasonable procedure and the only way to undo the wrong is to quash the sentence of death."
d5_s53,"Reddy, J. was of the view that the sentence of death is one thing; sentence of death followed by lengthy imprisonment prior to execution is another."
d5_s54,"A period of anguish and suffering is an inevitable consequence of sentence of death, but a prolongation of it beyond the time necessary for appeal and consideration of reprieve is not."
d5_s55,And it was no answer to say that the man would struggle to stay alive.
d5_s56,"It was, therefore, found in that case that a delay exceeding two years in the execution of a sentence of death should be considered sufficient to entitle the person under sentence of death to invoke article 21 and demand the quashing of the sentence of death."
d5_s57,This Court did so and substituted the sentence of imprisonment in that case.
d5_s58,That decision was rendered on 16 February 1983.
d5_s59,The validity of that decision did not last long.
d5_s60,"On 24 March 1983, in Sher Singh & Ors. vs The State of Punjab, [1983] 2 SCR 582 1983 Indlaw SC 382, a bench of three learned Judges of this Court held that the prolonged delay in the execution of a death sentence is unquestionably an important consideration for determining whether the sentence should be allowed to be executed."
d5_s61,But no hard and fast rule that 'delay exceeding two years in the execution of a sentence of death should be considered sufficient to entitle the person under sentence of death to invoke article 21 and demand the quashing of the sentence of death' can be laid down as has been done in Vatheeswaran's case (supra).
d5_s62,"It is not necessary, therefore, to go into the aspect of this matter any more."
d5_s63,Chief Justice Chandrachud observed that a self imposed rule should be followed by the executive authority rigorously that every mercy petition should be disposed of within a period of three months from the date on which it was received.
d5_s64,"Long and interminable delay in the disposal of these petitions, it was observed, are serious hurdles in the dispensation of justice and indeed, such delays tend to shake the confidence of the people in the very system of justice."
d5_s65,"The learned Chief Justice stated that undoubtedly, the executive has the power, in appropriate cases, to act under the aforesaid provisions but, all exercise of power is preconditioned by the duty to be fair and quick."
d5_s66,"Delay defeats justice, it was observed."
d5_s67,"In this background, we have to consider the reasons given in the affidavit in this case."
d5_s68,We have set out the reasons advanced on behalf of the Government.
d5_s69,They are self explanatory.
d5_s70,"These do not, in our opinion, indicate any justifiable ground for keeping the Mercy Petitions of Daya Ram and Gyasi Ram pending for such a long time."
d5_s71,"Indeed, it is not disputed from the affidavit of the Under Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India that in the half yearly return Dt. 8 October 1985 and thereafter in the successive half yearly returns of the Uttar Pradesh Government upto 16 January 1989 year after year, the Mercy Petitions of Daya Ram remained unattended and undisposed of and consequently the Mercy Petition made to the President of India by Gyasi Ram was also undisposed."
d5_s72,The time and the manner in which the Mercy Petition has been dealt with in this case in respect of Gyasi Ram make sad reading and speak of the deplorable lack of speed and promptitude which in these matters should be there.
d5_s73,"In the meantime, there is no denying the fact that Gyasi Ram has suffered a great deal of mental pain and agony."
d5_s74,His condition has been described by the learned Sessions Judge as indicated hereinbefore.
d5_s75,"Whether death sentence is the appropriate punishment for the crime of murder, cold blooded in certain cases, is another debate."
d5_s76,This Court in Bachan Singh v.
d5_s77,"State of Punjab, [1983] 1 SCR 145 at page 221 of the report, observed as follows:"
d5_s78,"To sum up, the question whether or not death penalty serves any oenological purpose is a difficult, complex and intractable issue."
d5_s79,"It has evoked strong, divergent views."
d5_s80,"For the purpose of testing the Constitutionality of the impugned provision as to death penalty in Section 302, IPC on the ground of reasonableness in the light of articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution,, it is not necessary to express any categorical opinion, one way or the other, as to which of these two antithetical views, held by the Abolitionists and Receptionists, is correct."
d5_s81,"It is sufficient to say that the very fact that persons of reason, learning and light are rationally and deeply divided in their opinion, on this issue, is a ground among others, for rejecting the petitioners' argument that retention of death penalty in the impugned provision is totally devoid of reason and purpose."
d5_s82,"If, notwithstanding the view of Abolitionists to the contrary, a very large segment of people, the world over, including sociologists, legislators, jurists, judges and administrators still firmly believe in the worth and necessity of capital punishment for the protection of society, if in the perspective of prevailing crime conditions in India, contemporary public opinion channelized through the people's representatives in Parliament, has repeatedly in the last three decades, rejected all attempts, including the one made recently, to abolish or specifically restrict the area of death penalty, if death penalty is still a recognised legal sanction for murder or some types of murder in most of the civilised countries in the world, if the framers of the Indian Constitution were fully aware . of the existence of death penalty as punishment for murder, under the Indian Penal Code, if Thirty fifth Report and subsequent reports of the Law Commission suggesting retention of death penalty, and recommending revision of the Criminal Procedure Code and the insertion of the new sections 235(2) and 354(3) in that Code providing for pre sentence hearing and sentencing procedure on conviction for murder and other capital offences were before the Parliament and presumably considered by it when in 1972 73 it look up revision of the Code of 1898 and replaced it by the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, it is not possible to hold that the provision of death penalty as an alternative punishment for murder, in section 302, Penal Code is unreasonable and not in the public interest"
d5_s83,"We would, therefore, conclude that the impugned provision in section 302, violates neither the letter nor the ethos of Article 19."""
d5_s84,"In that decision, Bhagwati, J. (as the learned Chief Justice then was), dissented."
d5_s85,He held that death sentence was bad morally as well as Constitutionally.
d5_s86,It is no longer necessary in view of the majority judgment to deal with these views in detail.
d5_s87,This aspect was examined in several cases and a bench of five learned Judges considered this question again in Smt.
d5_s88,"Triveniben vs State of Gujarat, [1989] 1 SCC 678 1989 Indlaw SC 43, where Oza, J. speaking for the majority analysed the trend and observed at p. 688 that it was not necessary to go into the jurisprudential theories of punishment deterrent or retributive in view of what has been laid down in Bachan Singh's case (supra) with which learned Judges therein agreed."
d5_s89,"It is well settled now that undue long delay in execution of the sentence of death would entitle the condemned person to approach this Court or to be approached article 32 of the Constitution, but this Court would only examine the nature of delay caused and circumstances that ensued after sentence was finally confirmed by the judicial process and will have no jurisdiction to reopen the conclusions reached by the Court while finally maintaining the sentence of death."
d5_s90,But the court is entitled and indeed obliged to consider the question of inordinate delay in the light of all circumstances of the case to decide whether the execution of sentence should be carried out or should be altered into imprisonment for life.
d5_s91,No fixed period of delay can be considered to be decisive.
d5_s92,It has been emphasised that article 21 is relevant in all stages.
d5_s93,"Speedy trial in criminal cases though may not be fundamental right, is implicit in the broad sweep and content of Article 21."
d5_s94,Speedy trial is part of one's fundamental right to life and liberty.
d5_s95,This principle is no less important for disposal of mercy petition.
d5_s96,It has been universally recognised that a condemned person has to suffer a degree of mental torture even though there is no physical mistreatment and no primitive torture.
d5_s97,"See the 'observations of Shetty, J. in Triveniben's case (supra) at p. 7 13 7 14 of the report, where it has been observed that as between funeral fire and mental worry, it is the latter which is more devastating, for funeral fire burns only the dead body while the mental worry burns the living one."
d5_s98,"In the instant case, Gyasi Ram has suffered a great deal of mental agony for over eight years."
d5_s99,It is not disputed that there has been long delay.
d5_s100,We do not find reasons sufficiently commensurate to justify such long delay.
d5_s101,"The convict has suffered mental agony of living under the shadow of death for long, far too long."
d5_s102,He should not suffer that agony any longer.
d5_s103,"In the aforesaid facts and the circumstances of the case, therefore, we direct that the death sentence should not be carried out and the sentence imposed upon him be altered to imprisonment for life."
d5_s104,We order accordingly.
d5_s105,This W.P. is disposed of with the aforesaid direction.
d6_s1,"Tenant inducted in 1979, for three years, 2by the landlord under a written agreement, in C 4/33, Safdarjang Development Area, New Delhi, with permission of Controller under Section 21 of Delhi Rent Control Act (for brevity 'the Act') seeks leave of this Court on limited question of law if proceedings for recovery of possession under Section 21 of the Act could be initiated and continued by legal representatives of the landlord who had obtained permission but who died before expiry of period of tenancy."
d6_s2,"Answer of it shall depend, primarily, on construction of word 'landlord' used in Section 21, a provision held to be self contained code in Shiv Chand Kapoor vs Amar Bose, [1990] 1 SCC 234 1989 Indlaw SC 332 and also the purpose and objective of its enactment as provision of short duration tenancy or periodical tenancy in Rent Control Act of Delhi right from 1952, is unique amongst such legislations and is probably non existent in any other State."
d6_s3,It reads as under:
d6_s4,Recovery of possession in case of tenancies for limited period:
d6_s5,"(1) Where a landlord does not require the whole or any part of any premises for a particular period, and the landlord, after obtaining the permission of the Controller in the prescribed manner, lets the whole of the premises or part thereof as a residence for such period as may be agreed to in writing between the landlord and the tenant and the tenant does not, on the expiry of the said period, vacate such premises, then, notwithstanding anything contained in Section 14 or in any other law, the Controller may, or an application made to him in this behalf by the landlord within such time as may be prescribed, place the landlord in vacant possession of the premises or part thereof by evicting the tenant and every other person who may be in occupation of such premises."
d6_s6,"(2) while making an order under sub section (1), the Controller may award to the landlord such damages for the use or occupation of the premises at such rates as he considers proper in the circumstances of the case for the period from the date of such order till the date of actual vacation by the tenant."""
d6_s7,"What it, undoubtedly, projects is the legislative awareness of acute crisis of houses in the State."
d6_s8,"To resolve the paucity of accommodation, on one hand, due to enormous influx of office personnel and business class as a result of rapid growth of social, economic and political activity and apprehension of house owners, on other, bulk of whom hail from middle class or service class, of loosing their houses if not for good then for substantial period due to development of strange phenomenon in big cities that allotted or rented houses are more economical than, even, own the legislature which is the best judge of need of its people carved out an exception to usual rent control provisions of protecting tenants from eviction What was unique of it was not short duration tenancy but a fresh look on eviction."
d6_s9,"Vacant possession was ensured, statutorily, without any notice, or termination of tenancy or the hazard of establishing bona fide need and comparative hardship etc."
d6_s10,"Since sec. 21 is an exception to Section 14 and it mandates restoration of possession, ""notwithstanding any other law"" it has to be construed strictly and against any attempt to frustrate it."
d6_s11,"Intensity of it can be appreciated better if its language, is compared with other provisions of recovery of possession even though those provisions, namely, secs. 14A, 14B, 14C and 14D, were introduced later."
d6_s12,They also provide speedy remedy to recover possession.
d6_s13,But the landlord cannot succeed unless he is able to prove circumstances mentioned in it.
d6_s14,More than this the tenant has been given right to contest under Section 25B. Import of Section 21 on the other hand is altogether different.
d6_s15,"It enjoins Controller to place landlord in vacant possession after expiry of time without any right to tenant to contest it except to the limited extent that permission was vitiated by fraud as held in S.B. Noronah vs Prem Kumari Khanna, [1980] 1 SCC 52 1979 Indlaw SC 198 or misuse of the provision by land lord taking advantage of helpless situation of the tenant as held in V.S. Rahe vs Smt."
d6_s16,"Rem Chambeh, [1984] 1 SCC 612 1984 Indlaw SC 119; or the permission really did not create genuine tenancy as held in Shiv Chand Kapoor vs Amar Bose 1989 Indlaw SC 332, supra."
d6_s17,"Recovery of possession under Section 21 is not hedged, by any inquiry or opportunity, if permission is not challenged on any of those exceptions which have been carved out by courts, obviously, to uphold fairness and honesty the core of our jurisprudence."
d6_s18,"Right to get vacant possession is, thus absolute."
d6_s19,"Purpose and objective of the Section having been ascer tained, it may now be examined if the word ""landlord"" used in the second part of the Section which empowers landlord to make an application for recovery of possession is to be understood as the same landlord who made the application or his legal representatives as well."
d6_s20,"In other words, is there any justification for construing the word ""landlord"" in a narrow sense so as to restrict it, only, to the person who made the application and obtained permission. ""Landlord"" has been defined in Section 2(e) as under:"
d6_s21,"(e). 'landlord' means a person who, for the time being is receiving, or is entitled to receive, the rent of any premises, whether on his own account or on account of or on behalf of, or for the benefit of, any other person or who would so receive the rent or be entitled to receive the rent, if the premises were let to a tenant."" Expression, ""for the time being"" makes it clear, that land lord has to be understood in praesentii."
d6_s22,That is anyone entitled to receive rent is the landlord.
d6_s23,"It does not visualise, past or future landlord."
d6_s24,"Therefore, the word ""land lord"". on plain reading of Section 21 does not warrant construction of the word in any other manner."
d6_s25,"Basis for submission, however, that landlord in second part of Section 21 entitling him to claim vacant possession should be confined to the person who obtained permission was rounded on use of expression, ""who does not require the whole or any part of the premises for a particular period."" Attempt was made to personalise eviction proceedings by linking it with the person, due to whose non requirement the permission was granted resulting in automatic exclusion of legal representatives."
d6_s26,"To put it interpretationally the word ""landlord"", in second part was urged to be understood in a manner different than it is defined in Section 2(e)."
d6_s27,"Can it be said that context or setting of Section 21 is such that the word ""landlord"" in second part of it should be understood in a different sense than that in definition clause? Not on prima facie reading of it which has already been adverted to."
d6_s28,Neither on close analysis.
d6_s29,"What is visualised is occasion for short duration tenancy due to non requirement of whole or part of premises by landlord for time being; method of its creation by written agreement entered with tenant, statutory status to it by permission obtained from Controller and execution by restoration of vacant possession if the tenant does not vacate after expiry of period."
d6_s30,All condensed in one.
d6_s31,Constructionally it is in two parts one creation of short term tenancy and other its execution after expiry of time.
d6_s32,Both stand on their own and operate independently.
d6_s33,Non requirement of premises for time being furnishes basis for entering into agreement for periodical tenancy.
d6_s34,Truth of it on its genuineness are relevant considerations for granting permission.
d6_s35,But it exhausts thereafter except to the limited extent pointed out in decisions referred earlier.
d6_s36,"And the permission granted continues unabated, unaffected irrespective of variation in requirement."
d6_s37,"Necessity of landlord, again, does not entitle him to seek its revocation."
d6_s38,Even his death cannot shorten the period.
d6_s39,"Similarly once period expires the agreement, the permission all cease to operate by operation of law."
d6_s40,Nothing further is required.
d6_s41,Vacation is not linked with landlord but with time.
d6_s42,Expiry of it obliges tenant to vacate.
d6_s43,If he does not then the landlord may approach Controller for putting him in vacant possession.
d6_s44,Which land lord? Obviously whosoever is the landlord at the time of afflux of tenancy.
d6_s45,Death of landlord does not either shorten or enlarge period nor the consequences envisaged are altered or affected.
d6_s46,Use of expression notwithstanding any other law render it obligatory on tenant to vacate without questioning authority of landlord.
d6_s47,"Any other construction, may, as rightly observed by the High Court lead to disastrous consequences."
d6_s48,Even on principles of civil law the provision for recovery of possession being in nature of execution it could not be successfully resisted on the death of landlord due to whose non requirement the permission was granted.
d6_s49,Such narrow and unreaIistic construction of the word 'landlord' shall frustrate entire purpose of Section 21.
d6_s50,"Maxim of action personalies mortiur cum personna cannot apply, either, on principle or on facts."
d6_s51,In Supreme Bank v.
d6_s52,"P.A. Tendulkar, AIR 1973 SC 1104 1973 Indlaw SC 337 this Court while discussing applicability of the maxim held ""whatever view one may take of the justice of the principle it was clear that it would not be applicable to actions based on contract or where tort feasers' Estate had benefitted from a wrong done."
d6_s53,"Its applicability was generally confined to actions for damages for defamation, seduction inducing a spouse to remain apart from the other and adultery."" In Phool Rani vs Naubat Rai, [1973] 3 SCR 769 1973 Indlaw SC 350; a decision which was relied by petitioner in support of submission that an application filed for eviction of a tenant on bona fide need lapses on the death of landlord and it could not be continued by his legal representatives overruled in Shanti Lal Thakur Das and Ors. vs Chaman Lal Maganlal Telwala, [1977] 1 SCR 313 it was observed that doctrine of actio personalis moritur cum personna, did not apply to Rent Control Acts."
d6_s54,Even otherwise an action for eviction abates only if the cause of action does not survive.
d6_s55,What is the cause of action for an application for vacant possession in Section 21 death of landlord or expiry of time for which tenancy was created.
d6_s56,"Obviously the latter, the failure' of tenant to honour his commitment to vacate the premises after expiry of time for which he was inducted with permission of Controller."
d6_s57,The death of the person who obtained the permission has nothing to do with it.
d6_s58,Permission was obtained because the landlord did not require the premises on the date when it was let out to tenant.
d6_s59,That does not continue on the date when the tenant does not vacate the premises.
d6_s60,"The necessity of not requiring the premises, for some time, or for the duration the tenant was inducted was confined to the date when the permission was granted."
d6_s61,It could not be taken further to the time when the question of vacation arose.
d6_s62,The cause of action for granting permission was the non requirement by the landlord of the premises for the time mentioned in the agreement whereas cause of action for eviction is non vacation by the tenant after the expiry of period.
d6_s63,"Therefore, it is immaterial who is the landlord at the time when the Action for vacation arose."
d6_s64,"Even on facts permission was applied for by the landlord as, premises was surplus to his need for a limited period of 3 years due to the reason that his son had gone abroad and he was expected to return after three years."
d6_s65,Permission was granted for this reason on statement of parties.
d6_s66,Such necessity to let out or non requirement by the landlord could not be brought into those exceptions which invalidate permission.
d6_s67,Therefore death of the landlord was immaterial as even the reason for letting out did not die with death of landlord.
d6_s68,In the result this petition for special leave fails and is dismissed.
d6_s69,"In the circumstances of the case the tenant is directed to suffer costs which we quantify at Rs.5,000."
d6_s70,Petition dismissed
d7_s1,"This writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India is by the mother of the detenu Noor alias Babu to quash the detention order F. no. 801/1/90 PITNDPS dated 25.1.1990 passed under Section 3 of the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988 (in short 'PIT'NDPS Act') and the order of confirmation F. no. 801/1/90 PITNDPS dated 24.4.1990 'passed under Section 9(f) read with Section 10(2) of the 'PIT'NDPS Act, by the Central Government directing detention of the detenu for a period of two yeare w.e.f. 30.1.1990."
d7_s2,The only argument advanced in support of this writ petition is infraction of Article 22(5) of the Constitution of India.
d7_s3,The facts material for the point raised are stated hereafter.
d7_s4,"The detenu was arrested from his family estate at Kochuveetil House, Kuthugal, Udumpanchola Taluk, Idikki District, Kerala on 19.10.1989 on the accusation that he and his brothers were involved in extensive illicit cultivation of ganja plants (Cannabis Sativa) in violation of the provisions of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (in short 'NDPS Act'), He was produced before the Judicial Magistrate who rejected his bail application."
d7_s5,"The Sessions Judge also rejected the bail application once but late, granted conditional bail."
d7_s6,"Thereafter, the detention order dated 25.1.1990 was served on the detenu on 30.1.1990."
d7_s7,"It was stated therein that even though prosecution of the detenu was likely to be initiated under the NDPS Act, there was likelihood of the detenu indulging in cultivation and production of narcotic drugs (ganja) on the detenu being released on bail on account of which there was compelling necessity to detain him under the PITNDPS Act."
d7_s8,"The detenu was informed that he had a right to make representation to the detaining authority, Central Government and the Central Advisory Board against the detention order."
d7_s9,The mode of address of the representation to the Central Government and the Central Advisory Board was also indicated in the detention order along with the grounds of detention in accordance with Article 22(5) of the Constitution of India.
d7_s10,The detenu's case was referred by the Central Government to the Central Advisory Board on 2.3.1990.
d7_s11,"During pendency of the reference before the Advisory Board, the detenu made his representation on 24.3.1990 and addressed it to the Advisory Board."
d7_s12,The Advisory Board considered the reference relating to the detenu made by the Central Government and also the detenu's representation submitted to it.
d7_s13,"The Advisory Board, gave the opinion that there was sufficient cause to justify his preventive detention."
d7_s14,The Central Government then made the order dated 24.4.1990 confirming his detention and directed that the detenu Noor alias Babu be detained for a period of two years w.e.f. 30.1.1990.
d7_s15,It is admitted that the Advisory Board considered the detenu's representation before sending its opinion to the Central Government along with the entire record including the representation submitted by the detenu.
d7_s16,"It is also admitted that the Central Government made the order of confirmation dated 24.4.1990 on receipt of the opinion of the Advisory Board, but there was no independent consideration of the detenu's representation by the Central Government at any time."
d7_s17,"In the counter affidavit filed initially by Shri A.K. Roy, Under Secretary to the Government of India, this fact was not clearly stated and, therefore, we directed an additional affidavit to be filed."
d7_s18,"In the additional affidavit filed by Shri A.K. Roy, it has not been disputed that the Central Government did not at any time consider independently the detenu's representation addressed to and given to the Advisory Board."
d7_s19,"In the additional affidavit, the stand of the Central Government in this behalf has been stated thus:""."
d7_s20,"Since the detenu in the present case has not made any representation to the Central Government, the assertion in para 2 of the grounds of petition that no opportunity was afforded by the Central Government to the said detenu is vehemently denied."
d7_s21,"The question of consideration of a representation and providing of an opportunity would only arise when a representation is duly made to the Central Government."""
d7_s22,"On the above facts, the question is: Whether there has been any infraction of the guarantee under Article 22(5) of the Constitution as a result of Central Government's omission to consider the detenu's representation independent of its consideration by the Advisory Board? The Central Government's stand is that the detenu's representation being addressed to the Advisory Board to which it was submitted during pendency of the reference before the Advisory Board, there was no obligation on the Central Government also to consider the same independently since the representation was not addressed to the Central Government."
d7_s23,"The Constitutional mandate in Article 22(5) was considered recently by a Constitution Bench in K.M. Abdulla Kunhi and B.L. Abdul Khader vs Union of India and Ors., State of Karnataka and Ors., JT 1991 (1) SC 216 1991 Indlaw SC 473, in view of some conflict in earlier decisions of this Court regarding the detaining authority's obligation to consider the detenu's representation independently of the Advisory Board's duty in this behalf."
d7_s24,The Constitution Bench held as follows:
d7_s25,"It is now beyond the pale of controversy that the constitutional right to make representation under clause (5) of Article 22 by necessary implication guarantees the constitutional right to a proper consideration of the representation."
d7_s26,"Secondly, the obligation of the Government to afford to the detenu an opportunity to make representation is distinct from the Government's obligation to refer the case of detenu along with the representation to the Advisory Board to enable it to form its opinion and send a report to the Government."
d7_s27,"It is implicit in clauses (4) and (5) of Article 22 that the Government while discharging its duty to consider the representation, cannot depend upon the views of the Board on such representation."
d7_s28,It has to consider the representation on its own without being influenced by any such view of the Board.
d7_s29,The obligation of the Government to consider the representation is different from the obligation of the Board to consider the representation at the time of hearing the references.
d7_s30,The Government considers the representation to ascertain essentially whether the order is in conformity with the power under the law.
d7_s31,"The Board, on the other hand, considers the representation and the case of the detenu to examine whether there is sufficient case for detention."
d7_s32,The consideration by the Board is an additional safeguard and not a substitute for consideration of the representation by the Government.
d7_s33,"The right to have the representation considered by the Government, is safeguarded by cl. (5) of Article 22 and it is independent of the consideration of the detenu's case and his representation by the Advisory Board under cl. (4) of article 22 read with Section 8(c) of the Act. (See: Sk."
d7_s34,"Abdul Karim & Ors. vs State of West Bengal, [ 1969] 1 SCC 433 1969 Indlaw SC 262; Pankaj Kumar Chakrabarty & Ors. vs State of West Bengal, [1970]1 SCR 543 1969 Indlaw SC 128; Shayamal Chakraborty vs The Commissioner of Police Calcutta and Anr., [ 1969] 2 SCC 426 1969 Indlaw SC 132; B. Sundar Rao and Ors. vs State of Orissa, [ 1972] 3 SCC 1 1 1971 Indlaw SC 856; John Martin vs State of West Bengal, [1975] 3 SCR 2 1 1 1975 Indlaw SC 603; section K. Sekawat vs Stale of West Bengal, [1975] 2 SCR 161 1974 Indlaw SC 148 and Haradhan Saha & Anr. vs State of IVest Bengal and Ors., [1975] 1 SCR 778 1974 Indlaw SC 360)."" (emphasis supplied)"
d7_s35,It is thus clear that the obligation of the Government to consider the representation is different and in addition to the obligation of the Board to consider it at the time of hearing the reference before giving its opinion to the Government.
d7_s36,Consideration of the representation by the Government has to be uninfluenced by the view of the Advisory Board.
d7_s37,"In short, the detenu's right to have the representation considered by the Government under Article 22(5) is independent of the consideration of the detenu's case and his representation by the Advisory Board."
d7_s38,This position in law is also not disputed before us.
d7_s39,"The learned Solicitor General, however, contended that in the present case there being no representation addressed to the Central Government, the only representation made by the detenu being addressed to the Advisory Board during pendency of the reference, there was in fact no representation of the detenu giving rise to the Central Government's obligation to consider the same."
d7_s40,The question is: Whether this contention can be accepted in the face of the clear mandate in Article 22(5) of the Constitution?
d7_s41,"It is undisputed that if there be only one representation by the detenu addressed to the detaining authority, the obligation arises under Article 22(5) of its consideration by the detaining authority independent of the opinion of the Advisory Board in addition to its consideration by the Advisory Board while giving its opinion."
d7_s42,"In other words, one representation of the detenu addressed only to the Central Government and not also to the Advisory Board does not dispense with the requirement of its consideration also by the Advisory Board."
d7_s43,"The question, therefore, is: Whether one of the requirement of consideration by Government is dispensed with when the detenu's representation instead of being addressed to the Government or also to the Government is addressed only to the Advisory Board and submitted to the Advisory Board instead of the Government? On principle, we find it difficult to uphold the teamed Solicitor General's contention which would reduce the duty of the detaining authority from one of substance to mere form."
d7_s44,The nature of duty imposed on the detaining authority under Article 22(5) in the context of the extraordinary power of preventive detention is sufficient to indicate that strict compliance is necessary to justify interference with personal liberty.
d7_s45,It is more so since the liberty involved is of a person in detention and not of a free agent.
d7_s46,"Article 22(5) casts an important duty on the detaining authority to communicate the grounds of detention to the detenu at the earliest to afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the detention order which implies the duty to consider and decide the representation when made, as soon as possible."
d7_s47,"Article 22(5) speaks of the detenu's 'representation against the order', and imposes the obligation on the detaining authority."
d7_s48,"Thus, any representation of the detenu against the order of his detention has to be considered and decided by the detaining authority, the requirement of its separate consideration by the Advisory Board being an additional requirement implied by reading together clauses (4) and (5) of Article 22, even though express mention in Article 22(5) is only of the detain ing authority."
d7_s49,"Moreover, the order of detention is by the detaining authority and so also the order of its revocation if the representation is accepted, the Advisory Board's role being merely advisory in nature without the power to make any order itself."
d7_s50,"It is not as if there are two separate and distinct provisions for representation to two different authorities viz. the detaining authority and the Advisory Board, both having independent power to act on its own."
d7_s51,"It being settled that the aforesaid dual obligation of consideration of the detenu's representation by the Advisory Board and independently by the detaining authority flows from Article 22(5) when only one representation is made addressed to the detaining authority, there is no reason to hold that the detaining authority is relieved of this obligation merely because the representation is addressed to the Advisory Board instead of the detaining authority and submitted to the Advisory Board during pendency of the reference before it."
d7_s52,It is difficult to spell out such an inference from the contents of Article 22(5) in support of the contention of the learned Solicitor General.
d7_s53,"The contents of Article 22(5) as well as the nature of duty imposed thereby on the detaining authority support the view that so long as there is a representation made by the detenu against the order of detention, the aforesaid dual obligation under Article 22(5) arises irrespective of the fact whether the representation is addressed to the detaining authority or to the Advisory Board or to both."
d7_s54,The mode of address is only a matter of form which cannot whittle down the requirement of the Constitutional mandate in Article 22(5) enacted as one of the safeguards provided to the detenu in case of preventive detention.
d7_s55,"We are, therefore, unable to accept the only argument advanced by the learned Solicitor General to support the detention."
d7_s56,"On this conclusion, it is not disputed that there has been a breach by the Central Government of its duty under Article 22(5) of the Constitution of India to consider and decide the representation independently of the Advisory Board's opinion."
d7_s57,"The order of detention dated 25.1.1990 as well as the order dated 24.4.1990 of its confirmation passed by the Central Government are, therefore, quashed."
d7_s58,"This shall not, however, affect the detenu's prosecution for the alleged offence and it shall also not be construed as a direction to release him in case he is in custody as a result of refusal of bail."
d7_s59,"The writ petition is allowed, accordingly."
d7_s60,Pettion allowed
d8_s1,"All the above writ petitions have been filed by the doctors who after passing the M.B.B.S. examination, appeared for the Post Graduate Medical Entrance Examination (PGMEE) held by the Lucknow University in the year 1992, but remained unsuccessful as they secured less than 50% marks which were necessary for the students of general category and 40% marks for SC/ST according to the rules for admission applicable for Post Graduate course."
d8_s2,On 14.7.1992 we passed a detailed order and so far as the admission rules fixing 50% of the marks to be obtained at the entrance examination as minimum qualifying marks for admission to the Post Graduate medical courses are concerned the same were held to be legal and it was further held that no exception can be taken to the same.
d8_s3,"It was however, contended on behalf of the petitioners that as a result of the application of the aforesaid rule a large number of seats have remained vacant and in view of the observations made in Dr. Ambesh Kumar etc. etc., vs Principal, LLRM Medical College Meerut and Ors. etc. etc. [1987] 1 SCR 6611986 Indlaw SC 245 such a situation must be avoided and the remaining seats should be filled up by applying different criteria, the cases were postponed for further hearing."
d8_s4,We have heard learned cousel for the parties and have thoroughly gone through the record.
d8_s5,"So far as the validity of the admission rules fixing 50% marks for the general category candidates and 40% marks for the SC/ST category candidates to be obtained at the entrance examination as minimum qualifying marks for being eligible for admission to the Post Graduate medical courses, the same are not subject to any challenge as we have already held the same to be legal in our order dated 14.7.1922."
d8_s6,"Learned counsel for the petitioners made strenuous effort to persuade us to take a different view, but they failed in the said attempt."
d8_s7,"It may be further mentioned that this Court in Ajay Kumar Agrawal and Others. vs State of U.P. and others, [1991] 1 SCC 636 1990 Indlaw SC 574 observed as under :"
d8_s8,"It is not disputed that in Uttar Pradesh the prevailing practice was a 50 per cent for allowing Post Graduate Study to doctors with MBBS qualifications but taking their University examination as the base without any separate selection test, it is not the case of any of the parties before us that the selection is bad for any other reason."
d8_s9,"We are of the view that it is in general interest that the 50 per cent cut off base as has been adopted should be sustained."""
d8_s10,"The matter again came up for consideration before this Court and in State of Uttar Pradesh and Others vs Dr. Anupam Gupta etc., AIR 1992 S.C. 932 1992 Indlaw SC 334, it was held as under :"
d8_s11,"Thus it could be seen that this Court consistently laid down the criteria for conducting entrance examination to the post graduate degree and diploma courses in Medicine and the best among the talented candidates would be eligible for admission. 50% cut off marks was also held to be valid to achieve excellence in post graduate speciality."
d8_s12,Accordingly we uphold the prescription of 50% cut off marks to general candidates and 40% to SCs and STs together with 1.65% weightage of total marks i.e. 50 marks in total in entrance examination as constitutional and valid.
d8_s13,"Thus, we further hold that any challenge to the above rule laying down minimum percentage of marks for eligibility for admission to Post Graduate courses is no longer res integra."
d8_s14,"Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners then submitted that admittedly there were 439 seats available in the General category, out of which only 300 candidates secured minimum qualifying marks i.e. 50% marks and 139 seats are lying vacant."
d8_s15,Similarly in case of reserved category for SC/ST there were 96 seats out of which only 18 candidates secured 40% minimum qualifying marks and as such 78 seats are lying vacant.
d8_s16,It has been contended that in all 217 seats are lying vacant and large number of Professors and Readers meant for imparting teaching in the various disciplines of Post Graduate courses shall remain idle and the Government shall have to unnecessarily spend large funds for meeting their emoluments.
d8_s17,It was also submitted that there is a great dearth of Post Graduate doctors in the country and it would not only be a sheer wastage of money in paying salaries and other emoluments to the teachers but also in the maintenance and upkeep of infra structure available for teaching in the various disciplines of Post Graduate Courses.
d8_s18,It has been further submitted that it would not only be in the interest of the petitioners but also in the national interest if the vacant seats are filled by lowering the minimum percentage of qualifying marks in the entrance examination.
d8_s19,It has been submitted that the number of seats lying vacant is not small but it is large being 217 out of the total 535 seats.
d8_s20,"Learned counsel for the petitioners is this regard placed reliance on the following observations made by this Court in Dr. Ambesh Kumar etc. etc. vs Principal LLRM Medical College Meerut and Ors. etc. etc., [1987] 1 SCR 661 1986 Indlaw SC 245."
d8_s21,"It is pertinent to mention in this connection that the number of seats allotted to each of the prescribed courses is on the basis of two seats per professor and there is a crying necessity in the State for more experts in various disciplines in Medicine and Surgery etc."
d8_s22,It is incumbent on the State Government to see that all these seats earmarked for each of these disciplines or courses are filled up.
d8_s23,It appears from Annexure D to the petition in C.A. no. 6119 of 1983 that quite a considerable number of seats in various disciplines were kept vacant as the applicants did not fulfill the eligibility qualification framed by the State Government by its aforesaid order and as a result several Professors and Assistant Professors who are meant for imparting teaching in these disciplines were kept idle though a considerable fund had to be expended for meeting their emoluments.
d8_s24,"It is for the State to consider and to see that the seats are filled up in all the disciplines and they are not left vacant in spite of a large number of applicants applying for admission in the various disciplines and the State Government has to evolve such criteria of eligibility that all the seats in different M.D., M.S. degree and diploma courses are filled up""."
d8_s25,We have given our thoughtful consideration to the aforesaid submission.
d8_s26,It may be noted that the aforesaid rule of minimum qualifying marks for admission to Post Graduate courses was in vogue for the last many years and large number of seats remained vacant in earlier years also.
d8_s27,It was for the State Government to have taken note of such situation and to have amended the rules for admission so as to fill all the seats available for Post Graduate courses.
d8_s28,"So far as any mandamus or direction to be given by this Court is concerned, we refrain from doing so because this Court has repeatedly held that the rule laying down minimum qualifying marks for admission to Post Graduate medical courses is legal and no exception can be taken to the same."
d8_s29,Even in Dr. Ambesh Kumar's case 1986 Indlaw SC 245 (supra) the rule laying down minimum of 55% and 52% marks in MBBS respectively of admission to Post Graduate degree and diploma courses was held to be valid.
d8_s30,"An argument was raised in the aforesaid case that the State Government had no power to lay down further eligibility qualification for being considered for admission in the Post Graduate courses, in addition to the eligibility criteria laid down by the Medical Council in its regulations but the aforesaid contention was negatived and it was held as under :"
d8_s31,"The order in question merely specifies a further eligibility qualification for being considered for selection for admission to the post graduate courses (degree and diploma) in the Medical Colleges in the State in accordance with the criteria laid down by Indian Medical Council."
d8_s32,This does not in any way encroach upon the Regulations that have been framed under the provisions of section 33 of the Indian Medical Council Act.
d8_s33,"On the other hand in order to promote and further the determination of standards in institutions for higher education, the State Government who runs these colleges provide an additional eligibility qualification."""
d8_s34,"Thus, we are clearly of the view that once having held that the rule prescribed by the State Government laying down minimum qualifying marks in the entrance examination is valid and the State Government having followed the aforesaid rule in granting admission in Post Graduate courses, it cannot be held that such action is illegal."
d8_s35,There is no infringement of any legal right much less of any fundamental right of the petitioners.
d8_s36,We can only recommend that the State Government may take suitable step for redressing the long felt grievance of the doctors to fill up all the vacant seats for Post Graduate courses and which would be a step in the larger public interest also.
d8_s37,"The State Government may do so for admission to Post Graduate courses for 1992 and in that case, the State Government would take immediate steps without any loss of time so that the candidates may also join the 1992 academic session for Post Graduate studies without any disadvantage."
d8_s38,It is further made clear that in doing so such candidates who having secured more than 50% marks and having already been allotted the specialities would not be disturbed in any manner.
d8_s39,The vacant seats would however be filled strictly in accordance with merit in the entrance examination and according to the combined merit list of the whole State of Uttar Pradesh.
d8_s40,The State Government would be free to issue fresh order relaxing the requirement of minimum marks to such extent which may meet the necessity of maintaining academic standards for admission to Post Graduate courses as well as regulations the prescribed by the Medical Council of India in this regard.
d8_s41,"This, in our view, would be perfectly within the powers of the State Government and would not be violative of article 14 of the Constitution."
d8_s42,The above observations relate only in respect of the vacant seats of Post Graduate courses of 1992 and not in relation to any vacancies for the earlier years of 1990 or 1991.
d8_s43,"With the aforesaid observations, we dismiss all these petitions with no order as to costs."
d8_s44,The application for intervention No.2 in Writ Petition No.454 of 1992 also stands dismissed automatically.
d8_s45,Petitions dismissed.
d9_s1,"This appeal, by special leave, has been preferred against the judgment and order dated 23 February 2005 of Bombay High Court (Aurangabad Bench), by which the appeal preferred by the appellants was dismissed and their conviction under Section 304 B read with Section 34 IPC and sentence of 7 years RI imposed thereunder by the learned Sessions Judge, Aurangabad, was affirmed."
d9_s2,The deceased Bhimabai was daughter of PW.1 Tukaram Eknath Tambe resident of village Sanjkheda and she was married to appellant no. 1 Appasaheb son of Sheshrao Palaskar about two and half years prior to the date of incident which took place on 15 September 1991.

d9_s7,Her father PW.1 Tukaram along with some of his relatives went to the house of the accused and tried to persuade them not to ill treat Bhimabai.
d9_s8,"Thereafter, the accused treated Bhimabai properly but after about four months they again started harassing her."

d9_s10,"She also told her parents that her husband had asked her to bring an amount of Rs.1,000 1,200 for the purpose of household expenses and manure."
d9_s11,The case of the prosecution futher is that in the evening of 15 September 1991 a person came from village Palshi on a motorcycle and informed PW.1 Tukaram that Bhimabai was unwell.
d9_s12,PW.1 then immediately went to the house of the accused along with some of his relatives.

d9_s17,"After completion of investigation, charge sheet was submitted against the appellants and in due course, the case was committed to the Court of Sessions."
d9_s18,"The learned Sessions Judge framed charges under Sections 498 A, 304 B read with Section 34 IPC and Section 306 read with Section 34 IPC against both the appellants."
d9_s19,The appellants pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.
d9_s20,The prosecution in order to establish its case examined six wintesses and filed some documentary evidence.
d9_s21,The learned Sessions Judge after consideration of the material on record acquitted the appellants of the charges under Sections 498 A and 306 read with Section 34 IPC but convicted them under Section 304 B IPC and imposed a sentence of 7 years RI thereunder.

d9_s29,"It is, therefore, necessary to briefly examine the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. PW. 1 Tukaram, father of the deceased, has given details of the prosecution version of the incident in his statement in Court."
d9_s30,"He has deposed that in the marriage he had given rs. 20,000 as dowry."
d9_s31,"Initially, Bhimabai was treated well for about six months, but thereafter the appellants started ill treating her."
d9_s32,"Whenever Bhimabai came to her parental home, she used to complain that for some domestic reasons she was being harassed."
d9_s33,"When she had visited her parental home on the last occasion, she had said that her husband Appasaheb had asked her to bring rs. 1,000 1,200 for domestic expenses and for purchasing manure as he had no sufficient money."
d9_s34,"Bhimabai had complained to him that she was not being given proper food, clothings and even footwear and occasionally the appellant no. 1 used to beat her."
d9_s35,The last time she visited her parental home was during the festival of Nag Panchami and at that time she looked depressed.
d9_s36,"The witness has further deposed that on the date of incident, a man came from village Palshi on motorcycle and informed that he should immediately go there as Bhimabai was not well."
d9_s37,He then went to village Palshi along with other persons of his family where he reached after sun set.
d9_s38,He saw that Bhimabai was lying dead and froth was coming out of her mouth which was smelling of Thimet (insecticide).
d9_s39,"In his cross examination he has admitted that his statement that he had given Rs.20,000 in dowry at the time of marriage was incorrect and in fact he had given rs. 5,000 as dowry and the total expenses incurred in the marriage was about rs. 20,000."
d9_s40,He has also deposed that it was after about 1 1/2 years of marriage that Bhimabai first complained to him about the harassment being caused to her.
d9_s41,There used to be some bickering in the marital life of Bhimabai and her husband on trifling matters.
d9_s42,He has admitted that it was appellant no. 1 who had sent a person on motorcycle who had given information regarding Bhimabai being unwell and that both the appellants were present at the time of her funeral.
d9_s43,PW.2 Babaji is real brother of father in law of PW.1 Tukaram.
d9_s44,He has deposed that on an earlier occasion he had gone along with PW.1 and some others to the house of appellant no.1 to persuade him not to harass Bhimabai and to treat her well.
d9_s45,"In his cross examination he has admitted that when he had gone to village Palshi to talk with the appellants regarding the ill treatment being meted out to Bhimabai, there was no talk regarding monetary giving and taking."
d9_s46,He also admitted that he had not gone to attend that funeral of Bhimabai.
d9_s47,PW.5 Sumanbai is the mother of the deceased Bhimabai.
d9_s48,She has stated in her examination in chief that Bhimabai was being ill treated by the appellants and the reason for ill treatment was that they were demanding money to be brought from her parental home.
d9_s49,The last time Bhimabai visited her parental home was on the occasion of the festival of Nag Panchami and she had complained that she was being ill treated and was sometimes given beating for bringing money from her parents.
d9_s50,"She has specifically stated that for a period of six months after the marriage, Bhimabai was treated well and thereafter she had started complaining about the harassment being caused to her."
d9_s51,"In her cross examination, PW.5 Sumanbai has stated that after news about the condition of Bhimabai was given by a man from village Palshi, she along with her husband and some other relations went there and noticed that Bhimabai was lying dead in the house and froth was coming out of her mouth."
d9_s52,She has further stated that she did not make any enquiry as to how Bhimabai had died.
d9_s53,In her statement under Section 161 Cr.
d9_s54,"P.C. which was recorded very next day of the incident i.e. on 16 September 1991 she did not state that cause of ill treatment was ""a demand for money and a consequent beating""."
d9_s55,When confronted with her aforesaid statement under Section 161 Cr.
d9_s56,"P.C., she replied that she did not know why there was no mention in the said statement that the cause for ill treatment was ""a demand for money and a consequent beating""."
d9_s57,"She further stated that it will be correct to say that her daughter was receiving ill treatment as a result of ""domestic cause""."
d9_s58,The learned trial Judge then sought clarification from the witnesses by putting the following question. :
d9_s59,"Que: What do you mean by domestic cause""?"
d9_s60,"Ans.: What I meant was that there was demand for money for defraying expenses of manure etc. and that was the cause."""
d9_s61,In the very next paragraph she stated as under :
d9_s62,"It is not true to suggest that in my statement before the police I never said that ill treatment was as a result of demand for money from us and its fulfillment."
d9_s63,"I cannot assign any reason why police did not write about it in my statement."""
d9_s64,"PW. 3 Sandu, Police Patil of village Palshi has deposed that at about 4.20 p.m. on 15 September 1991, Narayan who is uncle of appellant no.1, Appasaheb, informed him that the wife of Appasaheb had expired."
d9_s65,He then went to the house of the appellant and saw Bhimabai lying with froth coming out of her mouth.
d9_s66,"Thereafter, he gave a report about the incident in writing at the police station."
d9_s67,"In his cross examination, he admitted that he did not make detailed enquiries as to what was the cause of death and where the incident had taken place."
d9_s68,"He has further deposed that Bhimabai had come to his house about six months earlier and had said all was not well between her and her husband, but she had not given any specific details."
d9_s69,"The main witnesses regarding the alleged demand of money and also harassment and beating to Bhimabai are her father and mother, viz., PW.1 Tukaram and PW.5 Sumanbai."
d9_s70,"In his examination in chief PW.1 has said that whenever his daughter came to her parental home, she used to complain that she was being subjected to harassment by the appellants on account of some ""domestic reasons"" and further that her husband (appellant no.1) had told her that while coming back from her parental home she should bring rs. 1,000 1,200 for expenses and for manure as he had no sufficient money."
d9_s71,"PW.5 Sumanbai has deposed that Bhimabai was receiving ill treatment as a result of ""domestic cause"" and to a specific question put by the Court as to what she meant by ""domestic cause"" she gave a reply that there was a demand for money for defraying expenses of manure etc."
d9_s72,It is important to note that in her statement under Section 161 Cr.
d9_s73,"P.C. which was recorded on the very next day of the death of Bhimabai, this witness did not state that the cause for ill treatment was ""a demand for money and a consequent beating""."
d9_s74,The evidence on record does not indicate that the police had any reason to favour the accused and deliberately omitted to mention about the alleged demand of money while recording the statement of PW.5 Sumanbai under Section 161 Cr.
d9_s75,"The evidence shows that the accused come from very humble background and they could not have exerted any kind of influence, financial or otherwise, upon the police so as to manage a statement favourable to them when in the course of investigation the statements of witnesses were being recorded under Section 161 Cr."
d9_s76,Accepting the statements of father and mother on their face value that utmost which can be held is that the appellant no.1 had asked his wife Bhimabai to bring money for meeting domestic expenses and for purchasing manure.
d9_s77,"Two essential ingredient of Section 304 B IPC, apart from others, are (i) death of women is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances, and (ii) women is subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or in connection with, any demand for ""dowry""."
d9_s78,"The explanation appended to sub section (1) of Section 304 B IPC says that ""dowry"" shall have the same meaning as in Section 2 of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961."
d9_s79,Section 2 of Dowry Prohibition Act reads as under :
d9_s80,"Definition of ""dowry"" In this Act ""dowry"" means any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly"
d9_s81,(a) by one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage or
d9_s82,"(b) by the parent of either party to a marriage or by any other person, to either party to the marriage or to any other person, at or before or any time after the marriage in connection with the marriage of the said parties, but does not include dowry or mahr in the case of persons to whom the Muslim Personal Law (shariat) applies."""
d9_s83,"In view of the aforesaid definition of the word ""dowry"" any property or valuable security should be given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly at or before or any time after the marriage and in connection with the marriage of the said parties."
d9_s84,"Therefore, the giving or taking of property or valuable security must have some connection with the marriage of the parties and a correlation between the giving or taking of property or valuable security with the marriage of the parties is essential."
d9_s85,Being a penal provision it has to be strictly construed.
d9_s86,Dowry is a fairly well known social custom or practice in India.
d9_s87,"It is well settled principle of interpretation of Statute that if the Act is passed with reference to a particular trade, business or transaction and words are used which everybody conversant with that trade, business or transaction knows or understands to have a particular meaning in it, then the words are to be construed as having that particular meaning. (See Union of India vs Garware Nylons Ltd., AIR (1996) SC 3509 1996 Indlaw SC 2404 and Chemicals and Fibres of India vs Union of India, AIR (1997) SC 558 1991 Indlaw SC 861)."
d9_s88,A demand for money on account of some financial stringency or for meeting some urgent domestic expenses of for purchasing manure cannot be termed as a demand for dowry as the said word is normally understood.
d9_s89,"The evidence adduced by the prosecution does not, therefore, show that any demand for ""dowry"" as defined in Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act was made by the appellants as what was allegedly asked for was some money for meeting domestic expenses and for purchasing manure."
d9_s90,"Since an essential ingredient of Section 304 B IPC viz. demand for dowry is not established, the conviction of the appellants cannot be sustained."
d9_s91,Learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted that there is absolutely no evidence either direct or circumstantial to show that Bhimabai committed suicide.
d9_s92,He has submitted that the insecticide Thimet is extensively used by the farmers for preservation of crop and is kept stored in their houses and it could be a case where Thimet accidentally got mixed with some food item and was consumed by Bhaimabai.
d9_s93,It has thus been submitted that no offence under Section 306 IPC is made out against the appellants.
d9_s94,We do not consider it necessary to examine this question.
d9_s95,"As already stated, the appellants were also charged under Sections 498 A and 306 read with Section 34 IPC but were acquitted of the said charges by the learned Sessions Judge, which order has attained finality for the reason that the State did not prefer appeal against the same."
d9_s96,The appeal before the High Court and also in this Court has been preferred by the appellants challenging their conviction under section 304 B read with section 34 IPC.
d9_s97,"It has been held in State of Andhra Pradesh vs Thadi Narayan, AIR (1962) SC 240 1961 Indlaw SC 171 that Section 423(1)(b)(i) of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (which corresponds to Section 386(b)(i) of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973) is clearly confined to cases of appeals preferred against orders of conviction and sentence, the powers conferred by this clause cannot be exercised for the purpose of reversing an order of acquittal passed in favour of a party in respect of an offence charged, in dealing with an appeal preferred by him against the order of conviction in respect of another offence charged and found proved."
d9_s98,"Therefore, we have refrained from expressing any opinion as to whether the appellants could be held guilty of having committed the offence under Section 498 A or 306 IPC on the basis of evidence available on record as their acquittal under the aforesaid charges has attained finality and cannot be reversed in the appeal filed by the appellants challenging their conviction under Section 304 B IPC."
d9_s99,"In view of the discussion made above, the appeal is allowed."
d9_s100,The judgment and order dated 23 February 2005 of the High Court and the judgment and order dated 04 January 1993 of the learned Sessions Judge convicting the appellants under Section 304 B IPC are set aside and the appellants are acquitted of the said charge.
d9_s101,The appellant no.1 is in custody.
d9_s102,He shall be released forthwith unless wanted in some other case.
d9_s103,The appellant no. 2 is on bail.
d9_s104,The sureties and bail bonds furnished by her are discharged.
d9_s105,Appeal allowed.
d10_s1,"This appeal is preferred against the judgment dated 19.8.2011 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in Criminal Appeal No.181 SB of 2000, whereby the High Court partly allowed the appeal filed by the appellants thereby confirming the conviction of the appellants with certain modifications."
d10_s2,"Briefly stated, case of the prosecution is that on the fateful day i.e. 18.11.1994, at about 8.00 A.M. in the morning the complainant Jagdish (PW 5) along with his two sons namely Sukhbir and Mange Ram (PW 6) were busy in cutting pullas (reeds) from the dola of their field."
d10_s3,"At that time, Jage Ram (A 1) and his sons Rajbir Singh @ Raju (A 2), Rakesh (A 3) and Madan (A 4) armed with jaily, pharsi and lathis respectively, entered the land where the complainant was working with his sons and asked them not to cut the pullas as it was jointly held by both the parties."

d10_s11,"Dr. Pardeep Kumar (PW 2) also examined the other injured persons, PW 5 Jagdish and PW 6 Mange Ram."
d10_s12,"Statement of Jagdish was recorded, based on which F.I.R. was registered at Police Station Taoru, Gurgaon under Sections 323, 324, 325 and 307 read with section 34 IPC."
d10_s13,PW 8 Ramesh Kumar (ASI) had taken up the investigation.

d10_s19,Jagdish further claims that he along with Rakesh caused injuries to the complainant party in exercise of right of private defence of property.
d10_s20,He has denied that Rajesh and Usha had seen the incident.
d10_s21,Raju (A 2) and Madan (A 3) stated that they were not present on the spot and they have been falsely implicated.
d10_s22,Rakesh (A 4) adopted the stand of his father Jage Ram.
d10_s23,"Upon consideration of oral and documentary evidence, the learned Additional Sessions Judge vide judgment dated 17.2.2000 convicted all the accused persons sections 307 and 325 IPC and sentenced them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for five years and one year respectively and a fine of rs. 500/ each with default clause."
d10_s24,"Aggrieved by the said judgment, the accused appellants filed criminal appeal before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana."
d10_s25,"The High Court vide impugned judgment dated 19.8.2011 modified the judgment of the trial court thereby convicted Jage Ram (A 1) section 325 IPC and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year, convicted second accused Rajbir @ Raju section 307 IPC and imposed sentence of imprisonment for five years as well the fine of Rs.500/ was confirmed by the High Court."
d10_s26,Sentence section 325 IPC (two counts) was modified as the sentence section 323 IPC and he was sentenced to undergo six months rigorous imprisonment.
d10_s27,Both the sentences were ordered to run concurrently.
d10_s28,High Court modified the sentence of Madan (A 3) Rakesh (A 4) section 323 IPC and sentenced them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months (two counts) respectively.
d10_s29,"In this appeal, the appellants assail the correctness of the impugned judgment."
d10_s30,"Ms. Vibha Datta Makhija, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants contended that the evidence of the witnesses suffers from material discrepancy and is self contradictory."
d10_s31,"It was submitted that injured witness Sukhbir was not examined in the court and neither CT Scan nor x ray nor operational notes of Sukhbir were produced before the court and in the absence of such material evidence, courts below erred in convicting the second accused section 307 IPC."
d10_s32,"Additionally, the learned counsel contended that the defence plea of private defence was not considered by the courts below in proper perspective."
d10_s33,"Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the respondent State contended that the evidence of all the witnesses satisfactorily establishes the overt act of the accused persons and Jagdish (PW 5) and Mange Ram (PW 6) being the injured witnesses, the veracity of these witnesses cannot be doubted."
d10_s34,"It was submitted that the medical evidence sufficiently corroborated the oral evidence and the prosecution has established the intention of the 2nd accused in causing attempt to commit murder of Sukhbir and in appreciation of the evidence, courts below recorded concurrent findings convicting the second accused section 307 IPC and the same warrants no interference."
d10_s35,We have carefully considered the rival contentions and gone through the impugned judgment and perused the materials on record.
d10_s36,"As it emerges from the evidence, complainant Jagdish (PW 5) and his two sons Sukhbir and Mange Ram were cutting pullas."
d10_s37,The accused party went there and asked them not to cut the pullas.
d10_s38,"In the wordy altercation, second accused Rajbir @ Raju gave pharsi blows on the head of Sukhbir."
d10_s39,PWs 5 & 6 have clearly spoken about the overt act of the accused that A 1 Jage Ram attacked and caused injury to PW 5 Jagdish with jaily blows and that second accused Rajbir @ Raju attacked on the head of Sukhbir with pharsi.
d10_s40,They have also stated that Madan and Rakesh caused injuries to PW5 Jagdish with lathi on shoulder and left elbow respectively.
d10_s41,PW 2 Dr. Pardeep Kumar in his evidence stated that he has examined PWs 5 and 6 and noted the injuries on the body of PWs 5 and 6 and issued wound certificates.
d10_s42,Evidence of PWs 5 and 6 is amply corroborated by medical evidence.
d10_s43,"PWs 5 and 6 being injured witnesses, their evidence is entitled to great weight."
d10_s44,Cogent and convincing grounds are required to discard the evidence of injured witnesses.
d10_s45,"In the light of the fact that PWs 5 and 6 were injured witnesses, courts below tested their evidence for its credibility and recorded concurrent findings that PWs 5 and 6 are trustworthy witnesses."
d10_s46,We find no reason to take a different view.
d10_s47,Appellants have raised the contention that the prosecution failed to adduce evidence that A 2 Rajbir attempted to commit murder of Sukhbir.
d10_s48,"It was submitted that injured person Sukhbir was neither examined nor medical evidence like CT Scan, x ray and operational notes and Sukhbir were produced to corroborate the oral evidence and while so courts below erred in convicting second accused Rajbir @ Raju section 307 IPC."
d10_s49,"Dr. Pardeep Kumar PW 2, who examined Sukhbir found during his medico legal examination a lacerated wound in the middle of the top of the skull."
d10_s50,"Injured Sukhkbir was found vomiting in the hospital and he was examined by a Neuro Surgeon Dr. Hilol Kanti Pal (PW 9) of Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi on 19.11.1994, i.e. the day after the incident."
d10_s51,PW 9 has stated that Sukhbir was unconscious since 2.00 P.M. on 18.11.1994 and was deeply comatose with irregularity of pupils and a laceration was diagnosed on the right front parietal region.
d10_s52,"Further, PW 9 has stated that during the CT scan, it was revealed that a large extra dural haemotoma was present in the frontal region with mass effect and to avoid further deterioration of his condition, he was operated upon by frontal trephine craniopmy an haemotoma measuring about 125 ml was evacuated."
d10_s53,"PW 9 stated that had not the operation been conducted on Sukhbir and had not the extra dural haemotoma removed by operation urgently, the head injury caused to Sukhbir would have caused his death."
d10_s54,"As noted by the High Court, it is thus brought on evidence that had not surgical assistance been given to Sukhbir, he would have definitely died."
d10_s55,"For the purpose of conviction section 307 IPC, prosecution has to establish"
d10_s56,(i) the intention to commit murder and
d10_s57,(ii) the act done by the accused.
d10_s58,The burden is on the prosecution that accused had attempted to commit the murder of the prosecution witness.
d10_s59,Whether the accused person intended to commit murder of another person would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.
d10_s60,"To justify a conviction section 307 IPC, it is not essential that fatal injury capable of causing death should have been caused."
d10_s61,"Although the nature of injury actually caused may be of assistance in coming to a finding as to the intention of the accused, such intention may also be adduced from other circumstances."
d10_s62,"The intention of the accused is to be gathered from the circumstances like the nature of the weapon used, words used by the accused at the time of the incident, motive of the accused, parts of the body where the injury was caused and the nature of injury and severity of the blows given etc."
d10_s63,In the case of State of M.P. vs Kashiram & Ors.
d10_s64,"AIR 2009 SC 1642 = (2009) 4 SCC 26 2009 Indlaw SC 92, the scope of intention for attracting conviction section 307 IPC was elaborated and it was held as under:"
d10_s65,"It is sufficient to justify a conviction section 307 if there is present an intent coupled with some overt act in execution thereof."
d10_s66,It is not essential that bodily injury capable of causing death should have been inflicted.
d10_s67,"The section makes a distinction between the act of the accused and its result, if any."
d10_s68,"The court has to see whether the act, irrespective of its result, was done with the intention or knowledge and under circumstances mentioned in the section."
d10_s69,"herefore, an accused charged section 307 IPC cannot be acquitted merely because the injuries inflicted on the victim were in the nature of a simple hurt."
d10_s70,"This position was highlighted in State of Maharashtra vs Balram Bama Patil, (1983) 2 SCC 28 1983 Indlaw SC 414, Girija Shanker vs State of U.P.(2004) 3 SCC 793 2004 Indlaw SC 78 and R. Prakash vs State of Karnataka (2004) 9 SCC 27 2004 Indlaw SC 117."
d10_s71,Whether there was intention to kill or knowledge that death will be caused is a question of fact and would depend on the facts of a given case.
d10_s72,The circumstances that the injury inflicted by the accused was simple or minor will not by itself rule out application of section 307 IPC.
d10_s73,"The determinative question is the intention or knowledge, as the case may be, and not the nature of the injury."""

d10_s75,Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system to undermine the public confidence in the efficacy of law and society could not long endure under such serious threats.
d10_s76,"It is, therefore, the duty of every court to award proper sentence having regard to the nature of the offence and the manner in which it was executed or committed, etc."

d10_s78,"Having regard to the weapon used for causing the head injuries to Sukhbir, nature of injures, situs of the injury and the severity of the blows, courts below recorded concurrent findings convicting the 2nd appellant section 307 IPC."
d10_s79,"In our considered view, the conviction of the second appellant Rajbir @ Raju section 307 IPC is unassailable."
d10_s80,"Learned counsel for the appellants contended that the second appellant is in custody for more than three years and since the occurrence was in the year 1994, prayed for reduction of the sentence imposed on the second appellant to the period already undergone."
d10_s81,"Placing reliance upon the judgment of this Court in Hari Singh vs Sukhbir Singh & Ors (1988) 4 SCC 551 1988 Indlaw SC 27., learned counsel for the appellants additionally submitted that in terms of section 357 (3) Cr."
d10_s82,P.C. that the compensation may be awarded to the victim and the sentence be modified to the period already undergone.
d10_s83,"For the conviction section 307 IPC, courts below imposed upon the 2nd appellant rigorous imprisonment of five years, while imposing punishment, courts have an obligation to award appropriate punishment."
d10_s84,Question of awarding sentence is a matter of discretion and the same has to be exercised by the courts taking into consideration all the relevant circumstances.
d10_s85,"What sentence would meet the ends of justice would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case and the courts must keep in mind the gravity of the offence, motive for the crime, nature of the offence and all other attendant circumstances."

d10_s87,"In the light of the above, considering the case in hand, the occurrence was of the year 1994 when the complainant party was cutting pullas, the accused asked them not to cut the pullas which resulted in the wordy altercation."

d10_s92,"As noticed above, injured Sukhbir sustained grievous head injuries and was deeply comatose and was in a state of shock and trauma."
d10_s93,Learned counsel for the injured witness submitted that for quite some time injured Sukhbir was unconscious and thereafter suffering from mental trauma.
d10_s94,"Having regard to the nature of injuries sustained by Sukhbir and the period of treatment and other circumstances, we are of the view that, it would be appropriate to direct second appellant accused Rajbir @ Raju to pay Rs.7,50,000/ as compensation to the injured Sukhbir."
d10_s95,"When the matter came up for hearing on 14.10.2014, learned counsel for the appellants informed the Court that he had offered Rs.5,00,000/ by way of demand draft towards compensation to the injured Sukhbir in the presence of the Sarpanch of the village which he has refused to receive the same."
